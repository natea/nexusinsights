# Feature Overview Specification: IntelligentSearchAndComprehensiveItemDisplay - Backend Integration

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-05-12
**Change Request ID:** `CR_Assessment_ISCD_20250512T131408`
**Target Component:** [`NexusInsight/src/pages/SearchPage.tsx`](NexusInsight/src/pages/SearchPage.tsx:1)
**Context:** Refinement & Maintenance phase. This specification addresses the identified gap in backend connectivity for the feature, replacing mock data with live API calls to `wikidata-mcp`.

## 1. Overview and Goal

The primary goal of this specification is to detail the requirements for integrating the [`NexusInsight/src/pages/SearchPage.tsx`](NexusInsight/src/pages/SearchPage.tsx:1) component with the `wikidata-mcp` backend APIs. This integration involves replacing all existing mock data and simulated API call logic with actual, live data retrieval mechanisms. This will enable full, data-driven functionality for the intelligent search (including suggestions and results) and comprehensive item display features within the application.

## 2. User Stories

*   **US1:** As a user, I want to type a search query in the search input field so that I can receive real-time search suggestions fetched directly from the `wikidata-mcp` backend.
*   **US2:** As a user, I want to submit a search query so that the system fetches and displays relevant search results from the `wikidata-mcp` backend, replacing any mock data.
*   **US3:** As a user, I want to click on a search result item so that the system fetches and displays comprehensive details for that item from the `wikidata-mcp` backend.
*   **US4:** As a developer, I want the [`SearchPage.tsx`](NexusInsight/src/pages/SearchPage.tsx:1) component to utilize a well-defined service layer or hooks for interacting with `wikidata-mcp` APIs to ensure code modularity, maintainability, and testability.
*   **US5:** As a developer, I want clear error handling mechanisms implemented for all API requests, providing informative feedback to the user in case of failures (e.g., network issues, API errors, no results found).

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

*   **AC1:** When a user types three or more characters into the search input field, an API call is successfully made to the designated `wikidata-mcp` backend endpoint to fetch search suggestions.
*   **AC2:** Search suggestions retrieved from the backend are correctly parsed and displayed in the suggestions dropdown UI element.
*   **AC3:** Upon submitting a search query (e.g., by pressing Enter or clicking a search button), an API call is successfully made to the `wikidata-mcp` backend to retrieve a list of search results.
*   **AC4:** Search results obtained from the backend are accurately parsed and rendered within the [`SearchResultsDisplay`](NexusInsight/src/features/search/SearchResultsDisplay.tsx) component, replacing any mock data.
*   **AC5:** Clicking a specific search result item triggers an API call to the `wikidata-mcp` backend to fetch detailed information for the selected item, using its unique identifier.
*   **AC6:** Comprehensive item information (including, but not limited to, header details, descriptions, images, key information, statements/relationships, and metadata links) is correctly fetched, parsed, and displayed within the [`ItemDetailView`](NexusInsight/src/features/search/ItemDetailView.tsx) component.
*   **AC7:** All mock data sources and simulated API call logic previously used within [`SearchPage.tsx`](NexusInsight/src/pages/SearchPage.tsx:1) and its child components for search and item display functionalities are completely removed and replaced by live backend integrations.
*   **AC8:** Appropriate loading state indicators (e.g., spinners, skeleton screens) are displayed to the user during the time data is being fetched from the backend for suggestions, search results, and item details.
*   **AC9:** Errors originating from API calls (such as network errors, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error) are gracefully handled, and user-friendly error messages or notifications are displayed.
*   **AC10:** Configuration for `wikidata-mcp` API base URLs and any necessary API keys/tokens are managed through environment variables and are not hardcoded into the component.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### FR1: Search Suggestions API Integration
*   The system must initiate an API call to a `wikidata-mcp` endpoint (e.g., `/api/search/suggest?q={query}&limit={max_suggestions}`) to fetch search suggestions as the user types into the search input.
*   The API request must include the user's current input query string.
*   The frontend application must correctly handle the API response, parse the list of suggestions, and display them in a dropdown or similar UI element.
*   The API call should be debounced to avoid excessive requests.

### FR2: Search Results API Integration
*   The system must initiate an API call to a `wikidata-mcp` endpoint (e.g., `/api/search?q={query}&page={page_number}&limit={items_per_page}`) to fetch a list of search results when a user submits a search query.
*   The API request must include the full search query and may support pagination parameters.
*   The frontend application must correctly handle the API response, parse the search results (including essential information like item ID, label, description, and thumbnail URL if available), and display them.

### FR3: Item Details API Integration
*   The system must initiate an API call to a `wikidata-mcp` endpoint (e.g., `/api/items/{itemId}`) to fetch comprehensive details for a specific item when selected by the user.
*   The API request must include the unique identifier of the item.
*   The frontend application must correctly handle the API response, parse all relevant item details (e.g., labels in multiple languages, descriptions, aliases, statements/properties, sitelinks, images), and render them in the designated sections of the [`ItemDetailView`](NexusInsight/src/features/search/ItemDetailView.tsx).

### FR4: Data Transformation
*   The frontend application must be capable of transforming data received from `wikidata-mcp` APIs into the specific data structures and formats expected by the [`SearchPage.tsx`](NexusInsight/src/pages/SearchPage.tsx:1) component and its various sub-components.

### FR5: Error Handling and Reporting
*   The system must implement robust error handling for all API interactions. This includes detecting and managing network errors, HTTP error codes (e.g., 4xx client errors, 5xx server errors), and potentially malformed API responses.
*   User-friendly error messages or visual cues must be displayed to inform the user of any issues encountered during data fetching.

### FR6: Loading State Indicators
*   Visual loading indicators (e.g., spinners, progress bars, skeleton loaders) must be displayed prominently during API calls to provide feedback to the user that data is actively being fetched.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **NFR1: Performance:**
    *   Search suggestions should ideally appear within 500ms after the user stops typing (post-debounce).
    *   Search results for typical queries should load and display within 2-3 seconds.
    *   Detailed item information should load and display within 2-3 seconds after an item is selected.
*   **NFR2: Scalability (Frontend Perspective):**
    *   The frontend integration should efficiently handle and render data from `wikidata-mcp`, even with potentially large suggestion lists or detailed item data structures.
*   **NFR3: Maintainability:**
    *   API interaction logic should be encapsulated within dedicated service modules, custom hooks, or a state management solution's async thunks/queries to promote separation of concerns.
    *   The code implementing this integration must be well-documented, adhere to established project coding standards, and be easily understandable.
*   **NFR4: Security:**
    *   If the `wikidata-mcp` APIs require authentication or authorization (e.g., API keys, tokens), these credentials must be handled securely on the client-side (e.g., via environment variables, secure storage if applicable, and not exposed in version control).
    *   API endpoint URLs should be configurable via environment variables (e.g., `VITE_WIKIDATA_MCP_API_BASE_URL`) and not hardcoded.
*   **NFR5: Testability:**
    *   Service modules or hooks responsible for API communication should be designed to be easily mockable, facilitating effective unit and integration testing of the components that consume them.

## 6. Scope

### In Scope:
*   Complete replacement of mock data for search suggestions in [`SearchPage.tsx`](NexusInsight/src/pages/SearchPage.tsx:1) with live API calls to `wikidata-mcp`.
*   Complete replacement of mock data for search results in [`SearchPage.tsx`](NexusInsight/src/pages/SearchPage.tsx:1) with live API calls to `wikidata-mcp`.
*   Complete replacement of mock data for item details display within [`SearchPage.tsx`](NexusInsight/src/pages/SearchPage.tsx:1) and its relevant child components (e.g., [`ItemDetailView`](NexusInsight/src/features/search/ItemDetailView.tsx)) with live API calls to `wikidata-mcp`.
*   Implementation of appropriate loading state indicators for all backend data fetching operations.
*   Implementation of basic error handling mechanisms and user feedback for API failures.
*   Definition and utilization of reusable service functions, custom hooks, or equivalent patterns for managing API interactions.

### Out of Scope:
*   The development or modification of the `wikidata-mcp` backend APIs themselves (these are assumed to be pre-existing, stable, and documented).
*   Implementation of advanced search functionalities not currently supported or mocked (e.g., complex filtering logic, faceted search, advanced query syntax) unless explicitly part of the `wikidata-mcp` API contract for basic search.
*   User authentication and authorization mechanisms for the NexusInsight frontend application itself, unless directly required for consuming `wikidata-mcp` APIs.
*   Significant UI/UX redesign of the [`SearchPage.tsx`](NexusInsight/src/pages/SearchPage.tsx:1) or its child components, beyond what is necessary to accommodate live data and error states.
*   Implementation of client-side caching strategies for API responses (this can be considered a future enhancement).
*   End-to-end testing involving the live `wikidata-mcp` backend (focus is on frontend integration and mocking backend for tests).

## 7. Dependencies

*   **D1:** Stable and accessible `wikidata-mcp` backend environment.
*   **D2:** Well-defined and documented API contracts from `wikidata-mcp` for:
    *   Search suggestions (endpoint, request parameters, response schema).
    *   Search results (endpoint, request parameters including pagination, response schema).
    *   Item details (endpoint, request parameters, response schema).
*   **D3:** Reliable network connectivity between the client application environment and the `wikidata-mcp` server.
*   **D4:** An appropriate HTTP client library (e.g., `axios`, native `fetch` API) for making API requests from the frontend.
*   **D5:** Access to environment variable configuration for API base URLs and any necessary credentials.

## 8. API Design Notes / Frontend-Backend Interaction Model

### Interaction Flow Examples:
1.  **Search Input & Suggestions:**
    *   User types into the search field in [`SearchInput.tsx`](NexusInsight/src/features/search/SearchInput.tsx).
    *   Input is debounced.
    *   A service function/hook is called with the current query.
    *   Service function makes a GET request to `wikidata-mcp` (e.g., `/api/search/suggest?q=[query_string]&limit=10`).
    *   Response (e.g., JSON array of suggestion objects) is received and parsed.
    *   Suggestions are passed to [`SuggestionsDropdown.tsx`](NexusInsight/src/features/search/SuggestionsDropdown.tsx) for display.
2.  **Search Execution:**
    *   User submits the search query (e.g., presses Enter or clicks a search button).
    *   A service function/hook is called with the final query.
    *   Service function makes a GET request to `wikidata-mcp` (e.g., `/api/search?q=[query_string]&page=1&limit=20`).
    *   Response (e.g., JSON object with a results array and pagination info) is received and parsed.
    *   Results are passed to [`SearchResultsDisplay.tsx`](NexusInsight/src/features/search/SearchResultsDisplay.tsx) for rendering.
3.  **Item Detail View:**
    *   User clicks on an item in [`SearchResultItem.tsx`](NexusInsight/src/features/search/SearchResultItem.tsx).
    *   A service function/hook is called with the item's unique ID.
    *   Service function makes a GET request to `wikidata-mcp` (e.g., `/api/items/[item_id]`).
    *   Response (e.g., rich JSON object detailing the item) is received and parsed.
    *   Item details are passed to [`ItemDetailView.tsx`](NexusInsight/src/features/search/ItemDetailView.tsx) and its sub-components for rendering.

### Expected Data Formats (Illustrative - to be confirmed with `wikidata-mcp` API docs):
*   **Suggestions API Response:**
    ```json
    [
      { "id": "Q123", "label": "Example Suggestion 1", "description": "A brief description for suggestion 1." },
      { "id": "Q456", "label": "Example Suggestion 2", "description": "A brief description for suggestion 2." }
    ]
    ```
*   **Search Results API Response:**
    ```json
    {
      "query": "user search query",
      "results": [
        { "id": "Q789", "label": "Search Result Item A", "description": "Short description of item A.", "thumbnail_url": "http://example.com/thumbA.jpg" },
        { "id": "Q012", "label": "Search Result Item B", "description": "Short description of item B.", "thumbnail_url": "http://example.com/thumbB.jpg" }
      ],
      "pagination": {
        "total_results": 100,
        "current_page": 1,
        "per_page": 20,
        "total_pages": 5
      }
    }
    ```
*   **Item Details API Response:**
    A complex JSON object representing the item, potentially including fields like: `id`, `type`, `labels` (object with lang codes), `descriptions` (object with lang codes), `aliases` (object with lang codes), `statements` (object mapping property IDs to arrays of statement objects), `sitelinks` (object mapping site keys to site link objects), `modified`, `image_url`. The exact structure must align with the `wikidata-mcp` API specification.

### Error Handling Strategy:
*   Service methods/hooks should attempt to catch all errors from API calls (network errors, HTTP status code errors).
*   A consistent error object structure or custom error classes should be used to propagate error information to UI components.
*   UI components will use this error information to display appropriate user-facing messages (e.g., "Could not load suggestions. Please check your connection and try again.", "Failed to fetch details for this item.", "No results found for your query.").
*   Consider specific handling for 404 (Not Found) to mean "no results" vs. other errors indicating system issues.

### Configuration:
*   The base URL for the `wikidata-mcp` API must be sourced from an environment variable (e.g., `VITE_WIKIDATA_MCP_API_BASE_URL`).
*   Any API keys or authentication tokens, if required, must also be managed via environment variables.

### State Management Considerations:
*   The use of a library like React Query, SWR, or Redux Toolkit Query is recommended for managing asynchronous API data, including caching, request lifecycle states (loading, success, error), and automatic refetching. If not adopted, robust state management will need to be implemented using component local state (`useState`, `useReducer`) and `useEffect`.
