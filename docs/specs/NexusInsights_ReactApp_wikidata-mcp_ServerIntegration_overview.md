## 1. Introduction and Purpose

This document outlines the specification for integrating the NexusInsights React application with the `wikidata-mcp` backend server. The primary goal of this enhancement is to replace current mock data and simulated API interactions within the NexusInsights application with live data fetched directly from the `wikidata-mcp` server. This integration will enable dynamic, data-driven features, including real-time search suggestions, retrieval of comprehensive search results, and detailed item information display, significantly improving the user experience and data accuracy of the application.

## 2. User Stories

| ID  | User Story                                                                                                                               |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| US1 | As a user, I want to see search suggestions as I type in the search bar, so I can quickly find relevant terms and refine my search.        |
| US2 | As a user, I want to submit a search query and see a list of relevant results fetched from the live database, so I can explore available information. |
| US3 | As a user, I want to click on a search result or a suggested item and view detailed information about that item, so I can learn more about it. |
| US4 | As a developer, I want a clear and well-structured API service layer to interact with the `wikidata-mcp` server, so that data fetching logic is centralized, reusable, and maintainable. |
| US5 | As a developer, I want API endpoint configurations (like base URL) to be managed through environment variables, so the application can be easily deployed and configured for different environments. |

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

### For US1: Real-time Search Suggestions
*   **AC1.1:** Given a user is on a page with a search input field,
    When the user types three or more characters (e.g., "term") into the search input,
    Then a debounced API call is made to the `wikidata-mcp` server's `/api/search/suggest` endpoint with the typed "term".
*   **AC1.2:** Given the API call for suggestions is successful,
    When the server returns a list of suggestions,
    Then these suggestions are displayed in a dropdown list below the search input.
*   **AC1.3:** Given the API call for suggestions fails,
    When an error occurs,
    Then an appropriate, user-friendly error indication is shown (e.g., message in dropdown, or no dropdown).
*   **AC1.4:** Given the user clears the search input or types less than three characters,
    When the input is modified,
    Then the suggestions dropdown is hidden or cleared.

### For US2: Live Search Results
*   **AC2.1:** Given a user has entered a query (e.g., "search query") in the search input,
    When the user submits the search (e.g., presses Enter or clicks a search button),
    Then an API call is made to the `wikidata-mcp` server's `/api/search` endpoint with the "search query".
*   **AC2.2:** Given the API call for search results is in progress,
    When data is being fetched,
    Then a loading indicator is displayed to the user.
*   **AC2.3:** Given the API call for search results is successful,
    When the server returns a list of results,
    Then the search results are displayed in a designated area on the page (e.g., [`SearchResultsDisplay.tsx`](NexusInsight/src/features/search/SearchResultsDisplay.tsx)).
*   **AC2.4:** Given the API call for search results fails,
    When an error occurs,
    Then a user-friendly error message is displayed, indicating the search could not be completed.

### For US3: Detailed Item View
*   **AC3.1:** Given a user is viewing search results or suggestions,
    When the user clicks on an item (e.g., with ID "xyz123"),
    Then an API call is made to the `wikidata-mcp` server's `/api/items/{itemId}` endpoint (e.g., `/api/items/xyz123`).
*   **AC3.2:** Given the API call for item details is in progress,
    When data is being fetched,
    Then a loading indicator is displayed.
*   **AC3.3:** Given the API call for item details is successful,
    When the server returns detailed information for the item,
    Then this information is displayed in a designated view (e.g., [`ItemDetailView.tsx`](NexusInsight/src/features/search/ItemDetailView.tsx)).
*   **AC3.4:** Given the API call for item details fails,
    When an error occurs,
    Then a user-friendly error message is displayed, indicating the item details could not be retrieved.

### For US4: API Service Layer
*   **AC4.1:** Given the need to communicate with the `wikidata-mcp` API,
    When fetching data for suggestions, search, or item details,
    Then all API interactions are routed through a dedicated API service layer or custom hooks.
*   **AC4.2:** Given the API service layer,
    When making API calls,
    Then it correctly constructs requests, handles responses (including parsing and basic transformation), and manages loading/error states.

### For US5: Environment Configuration
*   **AC5.1:** Given the application needs to connect to the `wikidata-mcp` API,
    When the application is built or run,
    Then the base URL for the API is configurable via an environment variable (e.g., `VITE_WIKIDATA_MCP_API_BASE_URL`).

## 4. Scope

### 4.1. In Scope
*   Modification of existing React components to integrate live data:
    *   [`NexusInsight/src/pages/SearchPage.tsx`](NexusInsight/src/pages/SearchPage.tsx): Manage state and orchestrate data fetching for search and item views.
    *   [`NexusInsight/src/features/search/SearchInput.tsx`](NexusInsight/src/features/search/SearchInput.tsx): Implement debounced API calls for suggestions.
    *   [`NexusInsight/src/features/search/SearchResultsDisplay.tsx`](NexusInsight/src/features/search/SearchResultsDisplay.tsx): Display live search results.
    *   [`NexusInsight/src/features/search/ItemDetailView.tsx`](NexusInsight/src/features/search/ItemDetailView.tsx): Display live item details.
    *   [`NexusInsight/src/features/search/SuggestionsDropdown.tsx`](NexusInsight/src/features/search/SuggestionsDropdown.tsx): Display API-fetched suggestions.
*   Creation of a new API service layer (e.g., in [`NexusInsight/src/services/`](NexusInsight/src/services/) or custom hooks in [`NexusInsight/src/hooks/`](NexusInsight/src/hooks/)) to:
    *   Encapsulate all API communication logic with the `wikidata-mcp` server.
    *   Handle requests to `GET /api/search/suggest`, `GET /api/search`, `GET /api/items/{itemId}`.
    *   Parse API responses and perform necessary data transformations.
*   Implementation of basic error handling for API requests and responses.
*   Setup and utilization of environment variables for API configuration (e.g., base URL).
*   Definition and use of TypeScript types for API request payloads and response structures to ensure type safety.

### 4.2. Out of Scope
*   Advanced error handling strategies beyond basic feedback (e.g., retry mechanisms, detailed logging dashboards).
*   User authentication and authorization mechanisms, *unless* the `wikidata-mcp` API explicitly requires them for the specified endpoints. If authentication is required, it will become an in-scope dependency.
*   Complex client-side caching strategies beyond what might be offered by a chosen asynchronous state management library.
*   Offline support or data persistence beyond session-based interactions.
*   Significant UI redesign of the affected components beyond what is necessary for integrating live data.

## 5. Functional Requirements

*   **FR1:** The system **shall** provide real-time search suggestions to the user as they type into the search input field, by querying the `wikidata-mcp` server's `/api/search/suggest` endpoint.
*   **FR2:** The system **shall** perform searches against the `wikidata-mcp` server's `/api/search` endpoint based on user-submitted queries and display the results.
*   **FR3:** The system **shall** retrieve and display detailed information for a specific item by querying the `wikidata-mcp` server's `/api/items/{itemId}` endpoint when a user selects an item.
*   **FR4:** The system **shall** use a dedicated API service layer or custom hooks to manage all HTTP requests to and responses from the `wikidata-mcp` server.
*   **FR5:** The API service layer **shall** transform data received from the `wikidata-mcp` API into formats suitable for consumption by the frontend React components.
*   **FR6:** The system **shall** implement debouncing for search suggestion API calls to optimize performance and reduce server load.
*   **FR7:** The system **shall** display appropriate loading indicators to the user during data fetching operations.
*   **FR8:** The system **shall** display user-friendly error messages in case of API request failures or network issues.
*   **FR9:** The API base URL for the `wikidata-mcp` server **shall** be configurable through environment variables.
*   **FR10:** TypeScript types **shall** be defined and used for all `wikidata-mcp` API request and response DTOs to ensure data integrity and improve developer experience.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **NFR1 (Performance):** Search suggestions should appear within 500ms of the user pausing typing (after debounce). Search results and item details should load within 3 seconds under normal network conditions. Data transformation logic for complex JSON responses must be optimized to prevent UI lag.
*   **NFR2 (Reliability):** The application should gracefully handle API unavailability or errors, providing clear feedback to the user rather than crashing or displaying raw error data.
*   **NFR3 (Maintainability):** The API integration code (service layer/hooks) must be well-structured, documented, and easily understandable to facilitate future modifications and debugging. Adherence to DRY principles is expected.
*   **NFR4 (Scalability):** While client-side, the data fetching patterns should not impose undue repetitive load on the `wikidata-mcp` server (e.g., through efficient use of debouncing, and potential future consideration for caching if using libraries like React Query/SWR).
*   **NFR5 (Usability):** Error messages and loading states must be clear, concise, and non-intrusive, contributing to a positive user experience.
*   **NFR6 (Configurability):** The primary API endpoint (`VITE_WIKIDATA_MCP_API_BASE_URL`) must be configurable via environment variables.
*   **NFR7 (Security):** All communication with the `wikidata-mcp` server should use HTTPS. No sensitive information should be logged to the browser console in production builds. (Note: Authentication itself is out of scope unless required by API).

## 7. Dependencies

*   **D1:** A stable, accessible, and functional `wikidata-mcp` backend server environment.
*   **D2:** Comprehensive and accurate API documentation for the `wikidata-mcp` server, detailing:
    *   Exact endpoint paths (`/api/search/suggest`, `/api/search`, `/api/items/{itemId}`).
    *   Request parameters (query parameters, path parameters).
    *   Authentication and authorization mechanisms, if any.
    *   Precise request and response JSON schemas, including error response formats.
*   **D3:** Reliable network connectivity between the NexusInsights React application client and the `wikidata-mcp` server.
*   **D4:** An HTTP client library (e.g., `axios` or native `fetch` API) for making API requests.
*   **D5:** A mechanism for managing environment variables within the Vite build process (e.g., `.env` files).
*   **D6 (Highly Recommended):** An asynchronous state management library such as React Query or SWR to simplify data fetching, caching, and state synchronization, and to reduce boilerplate code.
*   **D7 (Conditional):** If the `wikidata-mcp` API requires authentication, a clear method for obtaining and using authentication tokens/credentials will be required.

## 8. High-Level UI/UX Considerations

*   **Search Input & Suggestions:**
    *   Suggestions should appear dynamically as the user types (debounced).
    *   The suggestions dropdown should be keyboard navigable.
    *   Clear visual distinction between the input field and the suggestions list.
*   **Loading States:**
    *   Use non-blocking loading indicators (e.g., spinners, skeleton screens) for search results and item details to inform the user that data is being fetched.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Display user-friendly, contextual error messages (e.g., "Could not load suggestions," "Search failed," "Unable to retrieve item details"). Avoid technical jargon.
    *   Provide a clear way for users to retry an action if applicable.
*   **Responsiveness:**
    *   Ensure all UI elements related to this integration (search input, suggestions, results display, item detail view) are responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.

## 9. API Design Notes (Frontend Perspective)

This section outlines the frontend's expectations and interaction patterns with the `wikidata-mcp` API.

*   **Consumed Endpoints:**
    *   `GET /api/search/suggest`
        *   Purpose: Fetch search suggestions based on user input.
        *   Expected Query Parameters: `q={searchTerm}` (or similar)
    *   `GET /api/search`
        *   Purpose: Fetch search results based on a full query.
        *   Expected Query Parameters: `q={searchQuery}` (potentially others like `limit`, `offset` for pagination if supported and in scope for V1).
    *   `GET /api/items/{itemId}`
        *   Purpose: Fetch detailed information for a specific Wikidata item.
        *   Path Parameter: `{itemId}` (the unique identifier of the item).
*   **Data Format:**
    *   All requests will expect JSON responses from the server.
    *   The frontend will send `Accept: application/json` headers.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   The frontend will expect standard HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure.
    *   Error responses should ideally be in JSON format, providing a `message` or `error` field for user feedback.
*   **TypeScript Definitions:**
    *   Strict TypeScript types will be defined for all expected API response structures to ensure type safety and facilitate development. This includes types for suggestion items, search result items, and the detailed item view.
*   **API Service Layer:**
    *   An abstraction layer (services or custom hooks) will be created to encapsulate the logic for:
        *   Constructing API request URLs and options.
        *   Executing HTTP requests using the chosen client library.
        *   Handling response parsing (JSON).
        *   Performing initial data transformation if the API response structure is not directly usable by UI components.
        *   Managing loading, success, and error states associated with API calls.

## 10. Open Questions / Items for Clarification

*   **Q1:** What are the exact and final schemas for the `wikidata-mcp` API responses for `/api/search/suggest`, `/api/search`, and `/api/items/{itemId}`? (Critical for TypeScript types and data transformation).
*   **Q2:** Does any `wikidata-mcp` API endpoint require authentication or authorization? If so, what is the mechanism (e.g., API keys, OAuth tokens)?
*   **Q3:** What are the expected rate limits, if any, for the `wikidata-mcp` API endpoints?
*   **Q4:** Are there specific error codes or error response structures from the `wikidata-mcp` API that the frontend should be prepared to handle in unique ways?
*   **Q5:** What is the minimum number of characters required to trigger search suggestions? (Assumed 3, confirm).
