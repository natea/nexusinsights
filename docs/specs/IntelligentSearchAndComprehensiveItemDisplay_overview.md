# Feature Overview Specification: Intelligent Search & Comprehensive Item Display

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-05-11
**Project:** NexusInsight

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the feature overview specification for the "Intelligent Search & Comprehensive Item Display" functionality within the NexusInsight project. This feature is designed to provide users with powerful, intuitive search capabilities for Wikidata entities and a clear, informative, and human-readable display for any selected item. A core dependency for this feature is the `wikidata-mcp` backend, which will be responsible for data retrieval, processing, and powering the semantic search capabilities. This specification is informed by the User Blueprint ([`docs/blueprint.md`](../../../docs/blueprint.md)) and initial research findings ([`research/05_final_report/01_executive_summary.md`](../../../research/05_final_report/01_executive_summary.md)).

## 2. User Stories

### 2.1. Intelligent Search
*   **US001:** As a user, I want to search for Wikidata items using natural language queries (e.g., "who was the first president of the United States", "cities in Germany with over 1 million inhabitants") so I can find information intuitively without needing to know specific Wikidata structures or SPARQL.
*   **US002:** As a user, I want to search for Wikidata items using specific keywords (e.g., "Berlin", "Q64") so I can quickly locate known entities or items by their identifier.
*   **US003:** As a user, I want to search for Wikidata items by describing their characteristics (e.g., "composer born in Austria before 1800", "paintings depicting mythological scenes") so I can discover items based on their attributes and relationships.
*   **US004:** As a user, I want the search to understand my query across multiple languages (e.g., searching in Spanish for an item primarily described in English or German) so I can access information regardless of my primary language or the item's primary language on Wikidata. This will be powered by `wikidata-mcp`.
*   **US005:** As a user, I want to see real-time search suggestions as I type in the search bar so I can refine my query, discover relevant items more quickly, and reduce typing errors.

### 2.2. Comprehensive Item Pages
*   **US006:** As a user, I want to view a clearly organized and human-readable page for any Wikidata item I select from search results or a direct link, so I can easily understand its key information without being overwhelmed by raw data.
*   **US007:** As a user, I want to see the most important facts (e.g., "instance of", "date of birth", "capital of"), descriptions, and relevant images for an item displayed prominently so I can get a quick and comprehensive overview.
*   **US008:** As a user, I want to see important relationships of the item to other items (e.g., "spouse of", "child of", "member of", "author of") clearly listed and linked, so I can understand its context and navigate to related entities.
*   **US009:** As a user, I want the item page to prioritize displaying labels, descriptions, and aliases in my preferred language (as set in my user profile or browser settings), with sensible fallbacks to other languages (e.g., English) if my preferred language is not available for a specific piece of information.
*   **US010:** As an expert user or developer, I want to easily find and copy the QID (for items) and PIDs (for properties shown on the page) so I can use them in other tools, queries, or for data verification.
*   **US011:** As a user, I want to see a direct link back to the original Wikidata item page on `wikidata.org` so I can verify information, explore further on Wikidata itself, or see the full data history.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

### 3.1. Intelligent Search
*   **AC001:** Given a natural language query, the system returns a ranked list of relevant Wikidata items, with the most relevant items appearing first. Relevance is determined by `wikidata-mcp`.
*   **AC002:** Given a keyword search (including QIDs), the system returns Wikidata items matching the keywords.
*   **AC003:** Given a characteristic-based search query, the system returns Wikidata items that match the described characteristics.
*   **AC004:** Semantic search successfully retrieves relevant items even if the query language differs from the primary language of the item's labels/descriptions on Wikidata, demonstrating `wikidata-mcp`'s multilingual capabilities.
*   **AC005:** Search suggestions appear in a dropdown list within 500ms of the user pausing typing or after a new character is entered.
*   **AC006:** Search results page clearly distinguishes between item labels and descriptions.

### 3.2. Comprehensive Item Pages
*   **AC007:** All displayed data for an item (labels, descriptions, facts, images, relationships) is sourced from the structured data provided by the `wikidata-mcp` server.
*   **AC008:** The item page displays the item's preferred label, description, and aliases in the user's selected language. If not available, it falls back to English, then to any available language.
*   **AC009:** Key facts (a curated set of important properties and their values) are prominently displayed in an easily scannable format.
*   **AC010:** Available images (e.g., from Wikimedia Commons via P18) are displayed, with appropriate attribution if required.
*   **AC011:** A configurable number (e.g., top 10-20) of important relationships are displayed, grouped logically (e.g., by property type or semantic category), with labels for properties and links to related items.
*   **AC012:** The item's QID is clearly visible on the page and can be copied to the clipboard with a single click.
*   **AC013:** PIDs for displayed properties are accessible (e.g., on hover or in a details section).
*   **AC014:** A direct, functional link to the item's page on `www.wikidata.org` is provided.
*   **AC015:** The item page loads completely, including primary content and images, within 3 seconds for 90% of items under typical network conditions.

## 6. Scope

### 6.1. In Scope
*   Development of a search input interface (e.g., a search bar).
*   Integration with `wikidata-mcp` for:
    *   Natural language search processing.
    *   Keyword search processing.
    *   Characteristic-based search processing.
    *   Multilingual semantic search capabilities.
    *   Real-time search suggestion generation.
    *   Retrieval of structured data for Wikidata items.
*   Development of a search results display page.
*   Development of the Comprehensive Item Page template.
*   Display of item labels, descriptions, aliases.
*   Display of key facts/statements.
*   Display of images (from Wikimedia Commons, via `wikidata-mcp`).
*   Display of important relationships to other items.
*   Implementation of language prioritization for textual content.
*   Functionality to easily view and copy QIDs and PIDs.
*   Providing a direct link to the item on `wikidata.org`.

### 6.2. Out of Scope
*   Direct SPARQL query input by users within this specific search interface (may be part of a separate "Advanced Search" or "Query Builder" feature).
*   Editing or contributing data back to Wikidata.
*   User authentication, user accounts, or personalized search history/preferences beyond language (unless specified as part of a broader NexusInsight platform feature).
*   Complex data visualizations on the item page itself (e.g., interactive graphs, timelines). These are intended for other dedicated features of NexusInsight like 'Interactive Visual Exploration'.
*   Offline access to item data or search functionality.
*   Caching strategies on the client-side beyond standard browser caching (server-side caching is `wikidata-mcp`'s responsibility).
*   The implementation of the `wikidata-mcp` server itself; this feature consumes its APIs.

## 7. Dependencies

*   **D001 (`wikidata-mcp` Server):** Critical dependency. This feature relies entirely on a functional, performant, and well-documented `wikidata-mcp` server providing the necessary APIs for all search types, suggestions, and comprehensive item data retrieval (including labels, descriptions, aliases, statements, images, relationships across multiple languages).
    *   Specific API endpoints for search, suggestions, and item data retrieval must be defined and stable.
    *   Performance characteristics of `wikidata-mcp` APIs must meet NexusInsight's NFRs.
*   **D002 (UI/UX Design Specifications):** Detailed wireframes, mockups, and interaction design guidelines for the search interface, search results page, and Comprehensive Item Page.
*   **D003 (Frontend Technology Stack):** The chosen frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte) and any supporting libraries for UI components and state management.
*   **D004 (Internationalization (i18n) Framework):** A framework or library to manage localization of UI chrome.
*   **D005 (Project-wide Style Guide):** Consistent visual styling and branding for NexusInsight.

## 8. High-Level UI/UX Considerations

*   **Search Interface:**
    *   A prominent, easily accessible search bar (e.g., in the application header).
    *   Clear visual feedback during query processing.
    *   Dropdown for real-time suggestions that is keyboard navigable.
*   **Search Results Page:**
    *   Paginated list of results.
    *   Each result should clearly display item label, a concise description, and a thumbnail image if available.
    *   Indication of why a result is relevant (e.g., matching terms highlighted).
*   **Comprehensive Item Page Layout:**
    *   **Header Section:** Prominent display of the item's primary label (title), its QID (copyable), and a short, defining description or alias.
    *   **Main Content Area:**
        *   **Primary Image:** If available, displayed prominently.
        *   **Key Information Box/Infobox:** A structured summary of the most salient facts (e.g., "instance of", "date of birth/death", "country of citizenship", "occupation" for a person; "capital", "population", "area" for a city).
        *   **Descriptions:** Longer textual descriptions if available.
        *   **Statements/Relationships:** Organized sections for different categories of relationships or properties (e.g., "Family", "Work and Education", "Associated With", "Physical Characteristics", "Identifiers"). Each property-value pair should be clearly presented, with values that are themselves Wikidata items linking to their respective NexusInsight item pages.
    *   **Metadata/Links Section:**
        *   Direct link to the item on `wikidata.org`.
        *   Language selection options for the current page view (if overriding global preference).
        *   Information about data freshness (if available from `wikidata-mcp`).
*   **Responsiveness:** The interface must be fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
*   **Accessibility:** Design and implementation should adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines. This includes keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, sufficient color contrast, and clear focus indicators.

          "image_url": "https://commons.wikimedia.org/...",
          "wikidata_url": "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q76",
          "key_facts": [
            { "property_pid": "P31", "property_label": "instance of", "value_qid": "Q5", "value_label": "human" },
            { "property_pid": "P27", "property_label": "country of citizenship", "value_qid": "Q30", "value_label": "United States of America" }
          ],
          "statements": {
            "P26": [ // spouse
              { "property_pid": "P26", "property_label": "spouse", "value_qid": "Q13133", "value_label": "Michelle Obama", "qualifiers": [...] }
            ],
            "P106": [ // occupation
              { "property_pid": "P106", "property_label": "occupation", "value_qid": "Q82955", "value_label": "politician" },
              { "property_pid": "P106", "property_label": "occupation", "value_qid": "Q185351", "value_label": "lawyer" }
            ]
            // ... other properties and their values
          }
        }
        ```

This API structure is illustrative. The `wikidata-mcp` team will define the canonical API, which NexusInsight will then consume. Close collaboration will be essential.
