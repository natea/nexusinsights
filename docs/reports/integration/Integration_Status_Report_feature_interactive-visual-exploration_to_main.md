# Integration Status Report: feature/interactive-visual-exploration to main

**Date:** 2025-05-12
**Feature Branch:** `feature/interactive-visual-exploration`
**Target Branch:** `main`
**Remote:** `origin`

## Summary

The integration attempt for feature 'interactive-visual-exploration' from `origin/feature/interactive-visual-exploration` into `main` found that the feature branch was **already merged** into the `main` branch. The `main` branch was up-to-date with `origin/main`. However, several files on the `main` branch had uncommitted local modifications at the time of this operation. These modifications were not related to the merge process of this specific feature branch.

**Overall Integration Status: Successful (Feature Already Integrated)**

## Detailed Steps and Outcomes

1.  **Initial Fetch & Prune:**
    *   Command: `git fetch origin --prune`
    *   Outcome: Success. Remote-tracking branches updated.

2.  **Target Branch (`main`) Verification & Update:**
    *   Command: `git checkout main`
    *   Outcome: Success. Already on 'main'.
        *   Noted Uncommitted Changes:

            ```
    *   Command: `git pull origin main`
    *   Outcome: Success. Branch 'main' already up to date with 'origin/main'.

3.  **Source Feature Branch (`origin/feature/interactive-visual-exploration`) Verification:**
    *   Command: `git ls-remote --heads origin feature/interactive-visual-exploration`
    *   Output: `0dd4877b01b7412efd09d51ef0cb02c9d9cb0b2c	refs/heads/feature/interactive-visual-exploration`
    *   Outcome: Success. Remote source branch exists.

4.  **Merge Status Check:**
    *   Command: `git branch --contains 0dd4877b01b7412efd09d51ef0cb02c9d9cb0b2c` (where `0dd4877...` is the tip of `origin/feature/interactive-visual-exploration`)
    *   Output:
        ```
          feature/interactive-visual-exploration
        * main
        ```
    *   Outcome: The command confirmed that the commit at the tip of `feature/interactive-visual-exploration` is already part of the `main` branch. Therefore, the feature is already integrated.

5.  **Merge Operation:**
    *   Not performed as the feature branch was already merged.

6.  **Push to Remote:**
    *   Not performed as no new merge commit was created. The `main` branch was already up-to-date with `origin/main` (aside from the local uncommitted changes).

## Conclusion

The version control integration task confirmed that the changes from `feature/interactive-visual-exploration` are already present in the `main` branch. No merge operation was necessary. The local `main` branch has uncommitted changes that should be addressed separately.
