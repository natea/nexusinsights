# Integration Status Report: feature/interactive-visual-exploration to main

**Date:** $(date +%Y-%m-%d\ %H:%M:%S)
**Feature Branch:** `feature/interactive-visual-exploration`
**Target Branch:** `main`
**Integration Success:** False

## Summary
The integration attempt for the feature branch `feature/interactive-visual-exploration` into the `main` target branch has failed. While the initial `git fetch origin --prune` and `git checkout main` operations were successful, the `main` branch was found to have uncommitted local changes. This prevents a clean update from `origin/main` and subsequent clean merge of the feature branch. The integration process was aborted due to this pre-condition failure.

## Steps Taken:

1.  **Initial Fetch**:
    *   Command: `git fetch origin --prune`
    *   Status: Success
    *   Output: (Terminal output for fetch would be here if captured, assuming clean)

2.  **Target Branch Verification & Update**:
    *   Command: `git checkout main`
    *   Status: Success (branch checked out)
    *   Output:
        ```
        Switched to branch 'main'

        ```
    *   **Issue**: The `main` branch has uncommitted local changes. Attempting to `git pull origin main` would lead to a dirty working tree or an attempt to merge/rebase over these local changes, which violates the requirement for a clean merge.
    *   **Action**: Integration aborted.

3.  **Source Branch Verification (Remote)**:
    *   Status: Not Performed (due to target branch pre-condition failure).

4.  **Merge Operation**:
    *   Status: Not Performed (due to target branch pre-condition failure).

5.  **Push to Remote**:
    *   Status: Not Performed.

## Conclusion
The integration cannot proceed until the uncommitted local changes on the `main` branch are addressed (e.g., committed, stashed, or reverted). A clean target branch is a prerequisite for a reliable version control integration.
