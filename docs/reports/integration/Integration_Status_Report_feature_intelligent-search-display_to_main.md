# Integration Status Report: feature/intelligent-search-display to main

**Date:** 2025-05-12
**Feature Branch:** `feature/intelligent-search-display`
**Target Branch:** `main`
**Integration Success:** False

## Summary
The integration attempt for feature 'intelligent-search-display' from `feature/intelligent-search-display` into `main` has failed. The primary reason for failure is that the specified project root directory, `/Users/nateaune/Documents/code/wikidata-mcp`, is not a git repository. This prevented any git operations, including the initial `git fetch`.

## Steps Attempted:

1.  **Setup & Initial Fetch**:
    *   **Command:** `git fetch origin --prune`
    *   **Working Directory:** `/Users/nateaune/Documents/code/wikidata-mcp`
    *   **Output:**
        ```
        fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
        ```
    *   **Status:** Failed. The directory is not a git repository.

## Conclusion
Integration cannot proceed as the project is not under git version control at the specified path. No further branch verification or merge operations could be performed.
