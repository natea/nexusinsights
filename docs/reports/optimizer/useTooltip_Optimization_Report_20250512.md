# Optimization Report: useTooltip.ts

**Date:** 2025-05-12
**Module:** [`NexusInsight/src/features/visual-explorer/hooks/useTooltip.ts`](NexusInsight/src/features/visual-explorer/hooks/useTooltip.ts)
**Feature:** InteractiveVisualExplorationOfConnections
**Problem Addressed:** Review for potential performance optimizations or refactoring opportunities.

## 1. Analysis

The `useTooltip.ts` custom hook provides state and functions (`showTooltip`, `hideTooltip`) to manage the visibility and content of a tooltip.
- It uses `useState` to manage the `tooltip` position/content and its `visible` state.
- It employs `useCallback` for the `showTooltip` and `hideTooltip` functions. This is a good practice as it memoizes these functions, preventing them from being recreated on each render of the consuming component, provided their dependencies (which are empty in this case) do not change.

## 2. Optimization Strategy

No specific optimization strategy was required as the hook is already well-structured for performance in its current scope. The use of `useCallback` is appropriate.

## 3. Changes Implemented

No code changes were made to [`NexusInsight/src/features/visual-explorer/hooks/useTooltip.ts`](NexusInsight/src/features/visual-explorer/hooks/useTooltip.ts).

## 4. Verification

N/A as no changes were made.

## 5. Outcome & Quantified Improvement

The hook is already efficiently implemented for its purpose. No performance improvements were necessary. The code is clear and follows React best practices for custom hooks.

## 6. Remaining Issues/Bottlenecks

- **Functional Consideration (Commented Code):** Line [`21`](NexusInsight/src/features/visual-explorer/hooks/useTooltip.ts:21) contains a commented-out `setTimeout` call: `// setTimeout(() => setTooltip(null), 200);`. This line, if uncommented, would introduce a delay before clearing the tooltip's content after it's hidden. This is a UX/functional decision rather than a performance bottleneck. If this behavior is desired, it can be uncommented. If not, it can be removed to slightly simplify the `hideTooltip` function. This does not represent a performance issue.

This report documents the review of `useTooltip.ts`. No optimizations were required.
