# Test Plan: NexusInsights React App - Wikidata-MCP Server Integration

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-05-12
**Feature Name:** `wikidata-mcp` server integration enhancement for the NexusInsights React app.
**Specification Document:** [`docs/specs/NexusInsights_ReactApp_wikidata-mcp_ServerIntegration_overview.md`](docs/specs/NexusInsights_ReactApp_wikidata-mcp_ServerIntegration_overview.md)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose
This document outlines the test plan for the integration of the NexusInsights React application with the `wikidata-mcp` backend server. The primary objective of this testing effort is to verify that the application correctly fetches, displays, and handles live data from the `wikidata-mcp` server, replacing mock data and simulated API interactions. This includes testing real-time search suggestions, retrieval of search results, detailed item information display, the API service layer, and environment configuration, as specified in the feature overview. The plan aims to ensure the feature meets functional, non-functional, and user experience requirements, leading to a high-quality, reliable, and performant integration.

### 1.2. Scope of Testing

#### 1.2.1. In Scope
*   Verification of all User Stories (US1-US5) and their Acceptance Criteria (AC1.1-AC5.1).
*   Testing of all Functional Requirements (FR1-FR10) related to API integration, data display, error handling, and configuration.
*   Testing of Non-Functional Requirements (NFR1-NFR7) including performance, reliability, maintainability (via code structure review), usability, configurability, and basic security aspects.
*   Integration testing of the React components ([`SearchPage.tsx`](NexusInsight/src/pages/SearchPage.tsx), [`SearchInput.tsx`](NexusInsight/src/features/search/SearchInput.tsx), [`SearchResultsDisplay.tsx`](NexusInsight/src/features/search/SearchResultsDisplay.tsx), [`ItemDetailView.tsx`](NexusInsight/src/features/search/ItemDetailView.tsx), [`SuggestionsDropdown.tsx`](NexusInsight/src/features/search/SuggestionsDropdown.tsx)) with the new API service layer/hooks.
*   Testing the API service layer/hooks for correct request construction, response handling, data transformation, and state management (loading/error) for endpoints:
    *   `GET /api/search/suggest`
    *   `GET /api/search`
    *   `GET /api/items/{itemId}`
*   Verification of environment variable usage for API base URL configuration (e.g., `VITE_WIKIDATA_MCP_API_BASE_URL`).
*   Validation of TypeScript type usage for API request/response DTOs.
*   Basic UI/UX testing for loading indicators, error messages, and responsiveness of integrated components.
*   Positive and negative test scenarios, including handling of API errors and network issues.

#### 1.2.2. Out of Scope
*   Advanced error handling strategies beyond basic user feedback (e.g., automated retry mechanisms, detailed logging dashboards).
*   User authentication and authorization mechanisms, unless the `wikidata-mcp` API explicitly requires them for the specified endpoints (as per spec D7). If required, basic auth flow testing will be added.
*   Complex client-side caching strategies beyond what is offered by a chosen asynchronous state management library (e.g., React Query, SWR, if used).
*   Offline support or data persistence beyond session-based interactions.
*   Significant UI redesign testing beyond what is necessary for integrating live data.
*   Exhaustive performance load testing of the `wikidata-mcp` server itself (focus is on client-perceived performance).
*   Full security penetration testing.

## 2. Test Strategy

### 2.1. Testing Levels
*   **Component Testing:** Individual React components involved in the integration will be tested in isolation where feasible, focusing on their interaction with the API service layer/hooks.
*   **Integration Testing:** Focus on the interaction between the React frontend components, the API service layer/hooks, and the `wikidata-mcp` backend server. This is the primary level of testing for this feature.
*   **End-to-End Testing (Manual/Lightweight Automation):** Simulating user flows from typing a search query to viewing item details.

### 2.2. Testing Types

#### 2.2.1. Functional Testing
Verify that all functionalities described in user stories, acceptance criteria, and functional requirements are implemented correctly. This includes:
    *   Correct data fetching and display for suggestions, search results, and item details.
    *   Debouncing mechanism for search suggestions.
    *   Functionality of the API service layer.

#### 2.2.2. API Integration Testing
Focus on the direct interaction with the `wikidata-mcp` API endpoints:
    *   Verify correct request formation (URLs, parameters, headers).
    *   Validate successful response handling and data parsing/transformation.
    *   Test handling of various HTTP status codes (2xx, 4xx, 5xx).
    *   Ensure TypeScript types align with actual API responses.

#### 2.2.3. Non-Functional Testing

##### 2.2.3.1. Performance Testing
    *   Measure response times for search suggestions (target <500ms after debounce).
    *   Measure load times for search results and item details (target <3s).
    *   Observe UI responsiveness during data fetching and transformation.

##### 2.2.3.2. Usability Testing
    *   Evaluate clarity and appropriateness of loading indicators.
    *   Assess user-friendliness of error messages.
    *   Check keyboard navigability for suggestions dropdown.
    *   General ease of use for the integrated search and display features.

##### 2.2.3.3. Reliability Testing
    *   Test how the application handles API unavailability or intermittent network issues.
    *   Ensure graceful degradation of functionality and clear user feedback.

##### 2.2.3.4. Configurability Testing
    *   Verify that the API base URL can be correctly configured using the specified environment variable (`VITE_WIKIDATA_MCP_API_BASE_URL`).
    *   Test with valid and invalid base URLs.

##### 2.2.3.5. Security Testing (Basic)
    *   Verify communication with the `wikidata-mcp` server uses HTTPS.
    *   Check that no sensitive information (if any were involved) is logged to the browser console in production builds.

#### 2.2.4. Error Handling and Negative Testing
    *   Simulate API errors (e.g., 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error, network timeout).
    *   Test with invalid search terms or item IDs.
    *   Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed to the user.
    *   Ensure the application does not crash or enter an unstable state.

#### 2.2.5. UI/UX Testing
    *   Verify visual consistency and correctness of displayed data.
    *   Test responsiveness of UI elements across different screen sizes (as specified in spec 8.4).
    *   Ensure loading states and error messages are displayed as per UI/UX considerations (spec 8.1-8.3).

### 2.3. Test Approach
*   **Requirements Review:** Thoroughly review the feature specification document.
*   **Test Case Design:** Develop detailed test cases based on user stories, ACs, FRs, and NFRs.
*   **Test Data Preparation:** Identify and prepare necessary test data, including valid and invalid inputs, and expected API responses (mocked where necessary for specific error conditions if the live server cannot easily simulate them).
*   **Test Execution:** Manually execute test cases. Automated tests (unit/integration for API service layer) will be developed by the development team and their results reviewed.
*   **Defect Reporting:** Log all identified defects with detailed steps to reproduce, actual vs. expected results, and severity.
*   **Regression Testing:** Re-test fixed defects and conduct regression testing on affected areas to ensure no new issues are introduced.

### 2.4. Test Completion Criteria
*   All planned test cases executed.
*   A predefined percentage of test cases passed (e.g., 100% for critical and high severity, 95% for medium).
*   All critical and high severity defects are fixed and verified.
*   No known outstanding critical or high severity defects related to the core functionality.
*   Test summary report approved.
*   Requirements traceability matrix completed.
