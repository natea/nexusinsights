*   Full-scale stress and load testing of `wikidata-mcp`.
*   Localization of UI chrome (buttons, labels not from Wikidata) - this might be tested as part of a separate i18n test effort, though basic checks for presence of elements will be done.

## 3. Test Strategy

### 3.1. Levels of Testing

#### 3.1.1. Unit Testing
*   **Objective:** To verify individual frontend components in isolation.
*   **Scope:** React components identified in the [Architecture Document](docs/architecture/IntelligentSearchAndComprehensiveItemDisplay_architecture.md) and [Framework Scaffold Report](docs/Framework_Scaffold_Report.md), such as:
    *   `SearchBar`
    *   `SuggestionsDropdown`
    *   `SearchResultItem`
    *   `ItemHeader`
    *   `ItemImageDisplay`
    *   `KeyInformationBox`
    *   `DescriptionsSection`
    *   `StatementsRelationshipsSection`
    *   `MetadataLinksSection`
    *   Utility functions and hooks.
*   **Approach:** Using Vitest and React Testing Library. Props will be mocked, and component rendering, event handling, and state changes will be verified.
*   **Responsibility:** Development team.

#### 3.1.2. Integration Testing
*   **Objective:** To verify interactions between components and with external services (mocked `wikidata-mcp` API).
*   **Scope:**
    *   Interaction between `GlobalSearch`, `SearchBar`, and `SuggestionsDropdown`.
    *   Interaction between `SearchResultsPage` and `SearchResultItem` components.
    *   Interaction between `ItemDetailPage` and its sub-components.
    *   Frontend components making API calls to `wikidata-mcp` (e.g., `GlobalSearch` for search/suggestions, `ItemDetailPage` for item data). API responses will be mocked.
    *   Routing between `SearchResultsPage` and `ItemDetailPage`.
*   **Approach:** Using Vitest and React Testing Library, focusing on data flow and communication between integrated parts. Mock Service Worker (MSW) or similar will be used to mock API responses from `wikidata-mcp`.
*   **Responsibility:** Development team, QA team.

#### 3.1.3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing
*   **Objective:** To validate complete user flows through the application, simulating real user scenarios.
*   **Scope:** Testing based on User Stories (US001-US011) and Acceptance Criteria (AC001-AC015).
    *   Performing a natural language search and navigating to an item page.
    *   Performing a keyword search (including QID) and verifying results.
    *   Using search suggestions.
    *   Verifying content and functionality on the item display page (labels, descriptions, facts, images, relationships, QID/PID, Wikidata link).
    *   Testing language preferences and fallbacks.
*   **Approach:** Using a UI automation framework (e.g., Cypress, Playwright). Tests will interact with the UI as a user would. May involve a test instance of `wikidata-mcp` if available and stable, otherwise mocked at a higher level.
*   **Responsibility:** QA team.

### 3.2. Types of Testing
*   **Functional Testing:** Verifying that all features work as specified in the requirements. Covered by Unit, Integration, and E2E tests.
*   **UI/UX Testing:** Ensuring the user interface is intuitive, user-friendly, and matches design specifications. Primarily through E2E and exploratory testing.
*   **Performance Testing (Basic):** Checking response times for search, suggestions, and page loads against NFRs (NFR001, NFR002, NFR003). This will be high-level; dedicated performance testing may be separate.
*   **Accessibility Testing (Basic):** Checking for keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, and color contrast against WCAG 2.1 AA (NFR004). This will be high-level; a dedicated accessibility audit may be separate.
*   **Compatibility Testing:** Testing on different browsers (latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and responsive design on various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
*   **Negative Testing:** Testing how the system handles invalid inputs, unexpected user actions, and error conditions (e.g., API errors from `wikidata-mcp`).

## 4. Test Environment

### 4.1. Frontend
*   **Browsers:** Latest stable versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge.
*   **Operating Systems:** Windows, macOS, Linux (for browser compatibility).
*   **Devices:** Desktop, Tablet (simulated/actual), Mobile (simulated/actual).
*   **Framework:** React with TypeScript, Vite (as per [Framework Scaffold Report](docs/Framework_Scaffold_Report.md)).

### 4.2. Backend
*   **`wikidata-mcp`:**
    *   For Unit and most Integration tests: Mocked API endpoints (e.g., using MSW).
    *   For E2E tests: Preferably a stable test instance of `wikidata-mcp`. If not available, comprehensive mocking or a controlled data subset might be used.

### 4.3. Test Tools
*   **Unit/Integration Testing:** Vitest, React Testing Library.
*   **E2E Testing:** Cypress or Playwright (to be decided).
*   **API Mocking:** Mock Service Worker (MSW) or similar.
*   **Browser Developer Tools:** For inspection and debugging.
*   **Test Management:** (To be decided - e.g., Jira, TestRail, or Markdown files in repo).
*   **CI/CD:** (To be decided - tests should be runnable in CI pipeline).

## 5. Test Data Requirements

Test data will be crucial for comprehensive testing. This includes:

*   **Search Queries:**
    *   Natural language queries (simple, complex, ambiguous).
    *   Keywords (single, multiple, with special characters).
    *   QIDs (valid, invalid, non-existent).
    *   Characteristic-based queries.
    *   Queries in different languages (e.g., English, Spanish, German).
    *   Queries expected to yield many results, few results, or no results.
*   **Wikidata Items (for Item Display & Search Results):**
    *   Items with complete information (labels, descriptions, aliases, images, multiple statements).
    *   Items with sparse information (e.g., missing descriptions, no image).
    *   Items with information in multiple languages.
    *   Items with information only in one language (e.g., only English).
    *   Items with various property types and value types (QIDs, strings, dates, coordinates).
    *   Items with long and short labels/descriptions.
    *   Items with many relationships vs. few relationships.
*   **Mock API Responses (for `wikidata-mcp`):**
    *   Successful search results (various scenarios).
    *   Empty search results.
    *   Search suggestions.
    *   Successful item data retrieval (various item structures).
    *   Item not found (404).
    *   Server errors (5xx).
    *   Rate limiting errors (if applicable).
    *   Responses simulating different language fallbacks.
    *   Responses for performance testing (simulating fast/slow `wikidata-mcp` responses).
