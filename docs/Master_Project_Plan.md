# Master Project Plan: NexusInsight

## 1. Project Overview

**Project Name:** NexusInsight
**Goal:** To create an intuitive, insightful, and trustworthy web application that allows users to visually explore and understand the rich interconnectedness of data within Wikidata, powered by the `wikidata-mcp` server.
**Source Blueprint:** [`docs/blueprint.md`](docs/blueprint.md:1)

## 2. Project Initialization Phase Summary

This phase focused on transforming the User Blueprint into an actionable project plan. Key activities included:

*   **Initial Research & Feasibility:** Conducted by `@ResearchPlanner_Strategic`. Key findings and recommendations are detailed in [`research/05_final_report/01_executive_summary.md`](research/05_final_report/01_executive_summary.md:1). This involved blueprint analysis and an initial feasibility study.
*   **Feature Definition & High-Level Architecture:** Major features were identified, specified, and architected. This involved feature decomposition and high-level design.
    *   **Feature 1: Intelligent Search & Comprehensive Item Display**
        *   Specification: [`docs/specs/IntelligentSearchAndComprehensiveItemDisplay_overview.md`](docs/specs/IntelligentSearchAndComprehensiveItemDisplay_overview.md:1) (by `@SpecWriter_Feature_Overview`)
        *   Architecture: [`docs/architecture/IntelligentSearchAndComprehensiveItemDisplay_architecture.md`](docs/architecture/IntelligentSearchAndComprehensiveItemDisplay_architecture.md:1) (by `@Architect_HighLevel_Module`)
    *   **Feature 2: Interactive Visual Exploration of Connections**
        *   Specification: [`docs/specs/InteractiveVisualExplorationOfConnections_overview.md`](docs/specs/InteractiveVisualExplorationOfConnections_overview.md:1) (by `@SpecWriter_Feature_Overview`)
        *   Architecture: [`docs/architecture/InteractiveVisualExplorationOfConnections_architecture.md`](docs/architecture/InteractiveVisualExplorationOfConnections_architecture.md:1) (by `@Architect_HighLevel_Module`)
*   **Dependency Identification:** A core dependency on the `wikidata-mcp` server has been established for data retrieval and processing across all features.

## 3. Project Roadmap - Next Steps

Based on the initialization phase, the following high-level roadmap is proposed:

1.  **Framework Scaffolding:**
    *   **Objective:** Set up the basic project structure, development environment, and frontend framework (likely React with TypeScript, as per architectural recommendations).
    *   **Key Tasks:** Initialize repository, configure build tools, set up linter/formatter, create basic application shell.
    *   **Lead:** `@Orchestrator_Framework_Scaffolding`
2.  **Feature Implementation (Iterative):**
    *   For each feature ("Intelligent Search & Comprehensive Item Display", "Interactive Visual Exploration of Connections"):
        *   **Detailed Design:** Refine UI/UX, component interactions, and API contracts.
        *   **Test Planning & Test Code Generation:** Create comprehensive test plans and initial test stubs/scaffolds (TDD approach).
            *   Lead: `@Orchestrator_Test_Specification_and_Generation`
        *   **Implementation:** Develop the feature based on specifications, architecture, and test plans.
            *   Lead: `@Orchestrator_Feature_Implementation_TDD`
        *   **Debugging (as needed):** Address any issues arising during development and testing.
3.  **Integration & System Testing:**
    *   **Objective:** Integrate implemented features and conduct end-to-end system testing.
    *   **Key Tasks:** Merge feature branches, resolve conflicts, execute system-wide tests.
    *   **Lead:** `@Orchestrator_Integration_and_System_Testing`
4.  **Refinement & Maintenance:**
    *   **Objective:** Address bugs, incorporate user feedback, and make enhancements post-initial release.
    *   **Lead:** `@Orchestrator_Refinement_and_Maintenance`

## 4. Key Technologies (Proposed)

*   **Backend Data Provider:** `wikidata-mcp` (existing)
*   **Frontend Framework:** React with TypeScript
*   **Graph Visualization:** Cytoscape.js (for "Interactive Visual Exploration")
*   **State Management:** Zustand (or similar lightweight library)
*   **Styling:** (To be determined - e.g., Tailwind CSS, Styled Components)

## 5. Risks and Mitigation

*   **Dependency on `wikidata-mcp`:**
    *   *Risk:* Performance bottlenecks or API limitations in `wikidata-mcp`.
    *   *Mitigation:* Close collaboration with `wikidata-mcp` maintainers; client-side caching and data optimization strategies.
*   **Complexity of Graph Visualization:**
    *   *Risk:* Performance issues with large datasets; usability challenges.
    *   *Mitigation:* Choose a performant library (e.g., Cytoscape.js); iterative design and user testing; progressive disclosure of information.
*   **Scope Creep:**
    *   *Risk:* Adding unplanned features during development.
    *   *Mitigation:* Strict adherence to defined feature specifications; clear change management process.

## 6. Project Team & Roles (High-Level)

*   **Project Initialization:** `@Orchestrator_Project_Initialization` (Current)
*   **Research:** `@ResearchPlanner_Strategic`
*   **Specification:** `@SpecWriter_Feature_Overview`
*   **Architecture:** `@Architect_HighLevel_Module`
*   **(Future Roles as per Roadmap)**

This Master Project Plan will be updated as the project progresses.
