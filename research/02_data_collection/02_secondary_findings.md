# Secondary Findings for NexusInsight Research

This document is intended to house secondary findings, such as broader contextual information, related studies, and tangential insights discovered during the research process for the NexusInsight project.

## Initial Pass - Placeholder

During the initial data collection phase, the focus was on directly addressing the key research questions outlined in [`research/01_initial_queries/02_key_questions.md`](research/01_initial_queries/02_key_questions.md). The primary responses from Perplexity AI are documented in:

*   [`research/02_data_collection/01_primary_findings_part1.md`](research/02_data_collection/01_primary_findings_part1.md)
*   [`research/02_data_collection/01_primary_findings_part2.md`](research/02_data_collection/01_primary_findings_part2.md)

This `02_secondary_findings.md` file will be populated if:

1.  Analysis of primary findings reveals a need for broader contextual research.
2.  Specific knowledge gaps identified in [`research/03_analysis/03_knowledge_gaps.md`](research/03_analysis/03_knowledge_gaps.md) necessitate exploration of related studies or technologies not directly covered by the initial queries.
3.  Targeted research cycles uncover relevant secondary information.

For now, this document serves as a placeholder.
