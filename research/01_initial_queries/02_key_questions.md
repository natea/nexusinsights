# Key Research Questions for NexusInsight

These key questions are derived from the research objectives and will guide the data collection process using Perplexity AI and other sources.

## 1. Feasibility of Core Concepts:

*   **Q1.1 (Interactive Visual Exploration):** What are the primary technical challenges and established solutions for implementing highly interactive, scalable, and performant graph visualizations (nodes and edges) for knowledge exploration, assuming pre-processed data from a backend like `wikidata-mcp`?
*   **Q1.2 (Visual Query Building):** What existing paradigms, UI patterns, and underlying logic are successfully used in visual query builders for complex datasets (especially graph-based)? How can these be adapted for Wikidata's structure, and what role would `wikidata-mcp` play in translating visual constructs into executable queries?
*   **Q1.3 (MCP Reliance):** How does reliance on `wikidata-mcp` for heavy lifting (data fetching, pre-processing, complex query execution) impact the feasibility and architectural choices for the NexusInsight client regarding these core visual features? What are the critical success factors for this client-server interaction?

## 2. Technological Landscape:

*   **Q2.1 (Frontend Frameworks):** Based on the requirements of NexusInsight (rich interactivity, data visualization, modern UX), what are the specific pros and cons of React, Vue, and Svelte for this project? Are there other notable contenders?
*   **Q2.2 (Visualization Libraries):** Which JavaScript/TypeScript data visualization libraries are best suited for rendering interactive and scalable network graphs (e.g., D3.js, Cytoscape.js, Vis.js, Sigma.js, React Flow) and other dynamic charts (timelines, maps) required by NexusInsight? What are their strengths in terms of performance, customization, community support, and ease of integration with modern frontend frameworks?
*   **Q2.3 (Client-Side Backend):** Under what circumstances would a dedicated client-side backend (Node.js/Python) be necessary for NexusInsight, considering `wikidata-mcp` handles primary data operations? What specific functionalities (e.g., user session management, complex UI state orchestration, API gateway logic for `wikidata-mcp`) would it manage?
*   **Q2.4 (User Data Storage):** For storing user-specific data (preferences, saved queries), what are the comparative advantages of PostgreSQL vs. MongoDB in the context of NexusInsight's potential needs? What are key considerations for schema design and data security?

## 3. Challenges & Mitigation:

*   **Q3.1 (Large-Scale Data Visualization):** What are best-practice techniques for visualizing and interacting with potentially very large graph datasets (e.g., progressive loading, level-of-detail rendering, clustering, filtering, efficient data structures) to maintain client-side performance and avoid overwhelming the user, even with `wikidata-mcp`'s help?
*   **Q3.2 (Performance & Responsiveness):** Beyond visualization, what are key frontend architectural patterns and optimization strategies to ensure overall application responsiveness and a fluid UX when dealing with dynamic data from `wikidata-mcp`?
*   **Q3.3 (Data Freshness):** How can NexusInsight effectively communicate data freshness (derived from `wikidata-mcp`'s sync cycle) to users? What are common strategies for client-side caching to improve perceived performance and handle intermittent connectivity, while respecting data updates from the server?
*   **Q3.4 (Intuitive UX for Diverse Users):** What UX design principles and interaction patterns are crucial for making complex data exploration accessible and engaging for a wide range of users, from novices to experts? How can NexusInsight balance power with simplicity?

## 4. Existing Tools & Inspirations:

*   **Q4.1 (Wikidata Tool Analysis):** For existing Wikidata tools (Reasonator, SQID, Scholia, WDQS), what are their specific strengths in terms of data presentation, querying, or unique features that NexusInsight could learn from or improve upon? What are their most significant weaknesses or pain points (e.g., performance, UI/UX, query complexity) that NexusInsight must avoid?
*   **Q4.2 (Visualization Platform Analysis):** For platforms like Kumu.io and Flourish, what specific aspects of their visualization interactivity, aesthetics, and user experience are particularly effective and could serve as inspiration for NexusInsight's visual exploration features?
*   **Q4.3 (Defining "Superiority"):** Based on the analysis of existing tools, what concrete features, performance benchmarks, or UX characteristics would define NexusInsight as a "superior" Wikidata client?

## 5. `wikidata-mcp` Server Interaction:

*   **Q5.1 (Interaction Patterns):** What are the most effective client-server interaction patterns (e.g., RESTful APIs, GraphQL, WebSockets) for communication between NexusInsight and `wikidata-mcp`, considering the need for fetching structured data, graph fragments, search results, and handling visual query translations?
*   **Q5.2 (Crucial API Endpoints):** What specific types of API endpoints would be essential on the `wikidata-mcp` server to support NexusInsight's core functionalities? Examples:
    *   `/entity/{QID}` for detailed item pages?
    *   `/entity/{QID}/connections?depth=N&filters=X` for graph exploration?
    *   `/search?query=Y&language=Z` for multilingual semantic search?
    *   `/query/visual` (or similar) to submit visual query constructs?
    *   `/visualize?type=timeline&params=A` for generating data for specific chart types?
*   **Q5.3 (API Design for Performance):** What API design considerations (e.g., payload optimization, pagination, caching directives, query parameterization for filtering/sorting) are critical for ensuring efficient data transfer and optimal performance between `wikidata-mcp` and NexusInsight?
*   **Q5.4 (Error Handling & Resilience):** How should the API design facilitate robust error handling and resilience in NexusInsight when `wikidata-mcp` encounters issues (e.g., query timeouts, missing data, server errors)?
