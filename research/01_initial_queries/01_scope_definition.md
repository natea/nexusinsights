# Research Scope Definition for NexusInsight

## Project Goal:
To develop NexusInsight, a superior Wikidata client application that offers intuitive, insightful, and engaging exploration of Wikidata's vast knowledge base. The client will heavily rely on a `wikidata-mcp` backend server for data processing, querying, and delivery, enabling NexusInsight to focus on an exceptional user experience.

## Research Objectives:

This research aims to inform the planning and development of the NexusInsight client application by addressing the following key areas:

1.  **Feasibility of Core Concepts:**
    *   Assess the technical feasibility of core features outlined in the User Blueprint, specifically:
        *   'Interactive Visual Exploration of Connections'
        *   'Visual Query Building'
    *   Consider the reliance on and interaction with the `wikidata-mcp` backend for these features.

2.  **Technological Landscape:**
    *   Identify and evaluate suitable frontend technologies:
        *   JavaScript/TypeScript frameworks (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte as suggested).
        *   Data visualization libraries suitable for large-scale graph data and interactive elements.
    *   Analyze backend considerations for the NexusInsight client application itself (if any, beyond the `wikidata-mcp` server), particularly for:
        *   User session management.
        *   Orchestrating complex calls to `wikidata-mcp`.
        *   Storing user-specific data (e.g., saved queries, preferences), considering PostgreSQL or MongoDB as suggested.

3.  **Challenges and Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Identify potential challenges in developing NexusInsight, including:
        *   Handling and visualizing large-scale graph data from Wikidata (even if pre-processed by `wikidata-mcp`).
        *   Ensuring high performance and responsiveness in visualizations and user interactions.
        *   Managing data freshness and synchronization with Wikidata (via `wikidata-mcp`).
        *   Achieving a truly intuitive User Experience (UX) for diverse user groups (novices to researchers).
    *   Propose potential mitigation strategies for identified challenges.

4.  **Existing Tools & Inspirations:**
    *   Briefly review existing Wikidata exploration tools mentioned in the blueprint (e.g., Reasonator, SQID, Scholia, WDQS).
    *   Review visualization platforms mentioned (e.g., Kumu.io, Flourish).
    *   Highlight key strengths to emulate and weaknesses to avoid in NexusInsight, focusing on achieving a *superior* client experience.

5.  **`wikidata-mcp` Server Interaction:**
    *   Elaborate on expected interaction patterns between the NexusInsight client and the `wikidata-mcp` server.
    *   Define API design considerations and crucial API endpoint types needed to efficiently support NexusInsight's features, such as:
        *   Entity data retrieval (item pages).
        *   Connection exploration (for visual graphs).
        *   Advanced search capabilities.
        *   Translation of visual queries into server-understandable queries.
        *   Data for dynamic visualizations (charts, timelines, maps).

## Out of Scope for this Initial Research Phase:

*   Detailed design or implementation of the `wikidata-mcp` server itself (though its capabilities are a core consideration).
*   Full UI/UX design mockups for NexusInsight (though UX principles will be discussed).
*   Detailed cost analysis for development or deployment.
*   Implementation of features marked as "Future Dreams" in the blueprint, unless directly relevant to core feasibility.
*   Direct Wikidata editing functionality.

This scope will guide the initial data collection and analysis, forming the basis for a comprehensive research report.
