# NexusInsight Strategic Research - Methodology

This section details the methodology employed during the initial strategic research phase for the NexusInsight project.

## 1. Research Scope and Objectives

The primary scope of this research was to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the feasibility, technological considerations, potential challenges, and design aspects for developing NexusInsight, a superior Wikidata client application. The research was framed by the objectives outlined in the User Blueprint ([`docs/blueprint.md`](../../../docs/blueprint.md)) and the specific research task provided.

Key objectives included:
*   Assessing the technical feasibility of core features: 'Interactive Visual Exploration of Connections' and 'Visual Query Building', particularly concerning reliance on a `wikidata-mcp` backend.
*   Identifying and evaluating suitable frontend technologies and backend considerations for the client application.
*   Identifying potential challenges in development (e.g., large-scale data handling, performance, UX) and suggesting mitigation strategies.
*   Reviewing existing Wikidata exploration tools and visualization platforms to draw inspiration and identify areas for improvement.
*   Elaborating on expected interaction patterns and API design considerations between the NexusInsight client and the `wikidata-mcp` server.

## 2. Key Research Questions

The research was driven by a set of key questions designed to address the objectives above. These questions covered five main areas:
1.  Feasibility of Core Concepts
2.  Technological Landscape
3.  Challenges & Mitigation
4.  Existing Tools & Inspirations
5.  `wikidata-mcp` Server Interaction

The complete list of key research questions is documented in [`research/01_initial_queries/02_key_questions.md`](../01_initial_queries/02_key_questions.md).

## 3. Information Sources and Tools

*   **Primary Information Gathering Tool:** Perplexity AI, accessed via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) tool. Specific models (e.g., `sonar-pro`) and settings (e.g., temperature, request for citations) were used to optimize query responses for factual and comprehensive information.
*   **Core Contextual Document:** The User Blueprint for NexusInsight, located at [`docs/blueprint.md`](../../../docs/blueprint.md), provided the foundational requirements and vision for the project.
*   **Output Documentation System:** A structured hierarchy of Markdown files within the `research` subdirectory, organized into folders representing different stages of the research process (initial queries, data collection, analysis, synthesis, final report).

A list of potential information sources brainstormed initially can be found in [`research/01_initial_queries/03_information_sources.md`](../01_initial_queries/03_information_sources.md).

## 4. Research Process

The research followed a structured, recursive self-learning approach, encompassing the following conceptual stages:

1.  **Initialization and Scoping:**
    *   Reviewed the research goal and User Blueprint.
    *   Defined the research scope ([`01_scope_definition.md`](../01_initial_queries/01_scope_definition.md)).
    *   Formulated key research questions ([`02_key_questions.md`](../01_initial_queries/02_key_questions.md)).
    *   Brainstormed potential information sources ([`03_information_sources.md`](../01_initial_queries/03_information_sources.md)).

2.  **Initial Data Collection:**
    *   Formulated targeted queries for Perplexity AI based on the key questions.
    *   Executed queries systematically.
    *   Documented primary findings, including direct responses and cited sources, in [`research/02_data_collection/01_primary_findings_part1.md`](../02_data_collection/01_primary_findings_part1.md) and [`research/02_data_collection/01_primary_findings_part2.md`](../02_data_collection/01_primary_findings_part2.md).
    *   Placeholders were created for secondary findings ([`02_secondary_findings.md`](../02_data_collection/02_secondary_findings.md)) and expert insights ([`03_expert_insights.md`](../02_data_collection/03_expert_insights.md)), to be populated in later cycles if necessary.

3.  **First Pass Analysis and Gap Identification:**
    *   Analyzed the content of the primary findings.
    *   Identified recurring patterns and themes ([`research/03_analysis/01_patterns_identified.md`](../03_analysis/01_patterns_identified.md)).
    *   Noted any contradictions or conflicting information (currently minimal, see [`research/03_analysis/02_contradictions.md`](../03_analysis/02_contradictions.md)).
    *   Critically documented unanswered questions, areas needing deeper exploration, and assumptions requiring validation in [`research/03_analysis/03_knowledge_gaps.md`](../03_analysis/03_knowledge_gaps.md). This document is key for driving future research.

4.  **Synthesis:**
    *   Developed an integrated model outlining a conceptual architecture and key operational flows for NexusInsight ([`research/04_synthesis/01_integrated_model.md`](../04_synthesis/01_integrated_model.md)).
    *   Distilled the most critical insights from the research to inform project planning ([`research/04_synthesis/02_key_insights.md`](../04_synthesis/02_key_insights.md)).
    *   Outlined potential practical applications and use cases for NexusInsight ([`research/04_synthesis/03_practical_applications.md`](../04_synthesis/03_practical_applications.md)).

5.  **Final Report Generation:**
    *   Compiled all findings and analyses into a structured final report within the `research/05_final_report/` directory, including this methodology section, an executive summary, detailed findings, in-depth analysis, recommendations, and references.
    *   Ensured adherence to documentation structure and file size constraints (splitting files if necessary, though not required for this initial pass).

## 5. Limitations of the Initial Research Phase

*   **Reliance on AI-Generated Summaries:** While Perplexity AI provides citations, the core information is processed and summarized by the AI. Direct consultation of all primary cited sources was not performed in this initial pass.
*   **`wikidata-mcp` Specifics:** The research relied on conceptual understanding of `wikidata-mcp`'s role. Detailed technical specifications, current implementation status, and performance benchmarks of the specific `github.com/zzaebok/mcp-wikidata` project were not available and are noted as a key knowledge gap.
*   **No Primary User Research/Interviews:** This phase did not involve direct user interviews or usability testing, which would be crucial for detailed UX design.
*   **Single Research Cycle:** This report is based on one primary cycle of data collection and analysis. Iterative refinement based on targeted research into knowledge gaps is planned for subsequent phases.

Despite these limitations, this initial research phase has provided a robust foundation for strategic planning and has clearly identified areas for focused follow-up investigation.
