# NexusInsight Strategic Research - Recommendations

Based on the findings and analysis from the initial research phase, this section provides strategic and technical recommendations for the NexusInsight project. These aim to guide project planning, mitigate risks, and maximize the potential for creating a superior Wikidata client.

## 5.1 Strategic Recommendations

1.  **Prioritize `wikidata-mcp` Assessment and Collaboration:**
    *   **Action:** Immediately initiate a thorough assessment of the target `wikidata-mcp` server ([`github.com/zzaebok/mcp-wikidata`](https://github.com/zzaebok/mcp-wikidata) or [github.com/ebaenamar/wikidata-mcp](https://github.com/ebaenamar/wikidata-mcp). This includes its current implementation status, API completeness, performance benchmarks, data freshness mechanisms, and development roadmap.
    *   **Rationale:** The research overwhelmingly indicates that NexusInsight's feasibility and success are critically dependent on `wikidata-mcp`. Understanding its current state and future plans is paramount. (See Knowledge Gap 1 in [`research/03_analysis/03_knowledge_gaps.md`](../03_analysis/03_knowledge_gaps.md)).
    *   **Collaboration:** Establish a close, ongoing collaboration channel with the `wikidata-mcp` developers to align roadmaps, co-design APIs, and address issues promptly.

2.  **Adopt a Phased Development Approach for NexusInsight:**
    *   **Action:** Plan the development of NexusInsight in iterative phases, rather than attempting a monolithic build.
        *   **Phase 1 (Foundation & Core Exploration):** Focus on establishing robust client-server communication with `wikidata-mcp`. Implement basic entity search, display of entity details, and simple, interactive exploration of direct connections. Validate core performance and `wikidata-mcp` integration.
        *   **Phase 2 (Advanced Visualization & Basic Query):** Enhance visualization capabilities (e.g., more complex layouts, filtering). Introduce a simplified version of the visual query builder, perhaps template-based or focused on common query patterns.
        *   **Phase 3 (Full Visual Query Builder & UX Refinement):** Develop the full-featured visual query builder with support for Wikidata-specific constructs. Conduct extensive UX testing and refinement.
        *   **Subsequent Phases:** User accounts, saved states, advanced analytical features.
    *   **Rationale:** A phased approach allows for early risk mitigation, continuous feedback, and adaptation based on learnings, especially concerning `wikidata-mcp`'s evolution and user responses.

3.  **Invest Heavily in UX/UI Design and Iterative Testing:**
    *   **Action:** Allocate significant resources to user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design from the outset.
    *   **Focus Areas:**
        *   Intuitive navigation of large, complex graphs.
        *   A visual query builder that is both powerful and accessible to non-SPARQL users.
        *   Clear presentation of information, avoiding cognitive overload.
        *   Catering to diverse user groups (novice to expert) through mechanisms like progressive disclosure.
    *   **Testing:** Implement a cycle of prototyping, user testing, and iterative refinement for key UI components, especially the visual graph explorer and query builder.
    *   **Rationale:** A superior UX is a primary goal of NexusInsight. Given the complexity of Wikidata and graph interactions, achieving this requires dedicated and skilled design effort. (See Knowledge Gap 3).

4.  **Focus on a Clear Value Proposition and Target Use Cases:**
    *   **Action:** While aiming for broad appeal, initially focus development and marketing on a few high-impact use cases where NexusInsight can offer clear advantages over existing tools (e.g., academic research, data journalism, as outlined in [`research/04_synthesis/03_practical_applications.md`](../04_synthesis/03_practical_applications.md)).
    *   **Rationale:** This helps prioritize features and provides a clearer path to demonstrating value and attracting an initial user base.

## 5.2 Technical Recommendations

1.  **Conduct Targeted Technology Prototyping for Frontend Stack:**
    *   **Action:** Before committing to a specific frontend framework (React, Vue, Svelte) and visualization library (Cytoscape.js, Sigma.js, etc.), build small-scale prototypes to test:
        *   Rendering performance with sample datasets representative of what `wikidata-mcp` will serve.
        *   Ease of implementing dynamic updates and interactive features (node expansion, filtering, dynamic layouts).
        *   Integration complexity between the chosen framework and visualization library.
        *   Developer experience and community support.
    *   **Rationale:** The research identified several strong candidates, but the optimal choice depends on the specific interplay of NexusInsight's requirements. Prototyping can de-risk this decision. (See Knowledge Gap 4).

2.  **Co-Design the Client-Server API with `wikidata-mcp` Developers:**
    *   **Action:** Use the API endpoint categories identified in the research (Section 3.5 of [`research/05_final_report/03_findings_part2.md`](03_findings_part2.md)) as a starting point for detailed API specification. Work closely with `wikidata-mcp` developers to refine these.
    *   **Key Considerations:**
        *   Support for incremental loading and pagination for all potentially large datasets.
        *   Efficient data formats for graph structures.
        *   Clear error handling and status codes.
        *   Mechanisms for schema introspection to support the visual query builder.
        *   Consideration of MCP principles if `wikidata-mcp` aims for dynamic tool/resource discovery.
    *   **Rationale:** A well-designed API is crucial for performance, scalability, and developer productivity on both client and server sides.

3.  **Implement Robust Performance Optimization and Scalability Strategies:**
    *   **Client-Side:**
        *   Employ WebGL-based rendering for graph visualizations.
        *   Use virtualization techniques (render only visible elements).
        *   Implement client-side caching for frequently accessed data/layouts.
        *   Optimize JavaScript performance (e.g., efficient state management, minimize re-renders).
    *   **Server-Side (`wikidata-mcp`):** This is primarily the responsibility of the `wikidata-mcp` team but NexusInsight should advocate for:
        *   Efficient query execution against Wikidata.
        *   Server-side caching of common queries and preprocessed data.
        *   Scalable architecture to handle concurrent users.
    *   **Rationale:** Performance is key to a good user experience, especially with data-intensive applications.

4.  **Plan for User-Specific Data Management Early (If Applicable):**
    *   **Action:** If features like saved queries, user preferences, or annotations are planned, define the scope and complexity of this data early. Choose a suitable storage solution (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) based on these requirements.
    *   **Rationale:** Integrating user-specific data can add complexity; addressing it early avoids architectural problems later. (See Knowledge Gap 5).

## 5.3 Next Steps for Research

To address the critical knowledge gaps identified, the following targeted research activities are recommended:

1.  **Deep Dive into `wikidata-mcp`:**
    *   Engage with `zzaebok/mcp-wikidata` or `ebaenamar/wikidata-mcp` developers (or current maintainers).
    *   Obtain detailed API documentation, performance data, and roadmap.
    *   If possible, conduct test queries against a live instance.
2.  **Visual Query Builder UX Prototyping:**
    *   Develop low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes of the visual query builder interface.
    *   Conduct usability testing with target users to evaluate different interaction patterns for constructing Wikidata-specific queries.
3.  **Visualization Performance Benchmarking:**
    *   Prototype key graph interaction scenarios using candidate frontend technologies with realistic (potentially simulated) data from `wikidata-mcp`.
    *   Benchmark rendering speed, interaction smoothness, and memory usage.
4.  **Comparative Analysis of Existing Tool Usability:**
    *   Conduct more in-depth usability reviews (or find existing studies) of tools like WDQS, Kumu.io, etc., focusing on specific tasks relevant to NexusInsight to establish quantitative improvement targets.

By following these recommendations and pursuing further targeted research, the NexusInsight project can build upon the solid foundation established in this initial phase and move confidently towards creating a truly superior Wikidata client.
