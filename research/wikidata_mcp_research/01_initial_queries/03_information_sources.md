# Information Sources: GitHub Repository `ebaenamar/wikidata-mcp`

This document identifies the primary and potential secondary information sources for the research on the `ebaenamar/wikidata-mcp` GitHub repository.

## 1. Primary Information Source: Context7 MCP Server

The **Context7 MCP server** is designated as the primary tool for gathering information about the `ebaenamar/wikidata-mcp` repository. This will involve:

*   **`resolve-library-id` Tool:**
    *   Used to identify the Context7-compatible library ID for the `ebaenamar/wikidata-mcp` repository. The input will be the repository name or URL.
    *   The output will provide a list of potential matches, from which the most relevant ID will be selected based on name similarity, description, and other metadata provided by the tool.

*   **`get-library-docs` Tool:**
    *   Used with the resolved Context7-compatible library ID to fetch documentation and code snippets from the repository.
    *   Queries will be formulated based on the key research questions, focusing on topics such as:
        *   Project overview and purpose (e.g., README content)
        *   Core functionalities and features
        *   Technical architecture and technology stack
        *   Installation, configuration, and usage instructions
        *   API details and integration points
        *   Code structure and key module descriptions

## 2. Secondary Information Sources (Potential/Limited)

*   **GitHub Repository Web Interface:** While Context7 is the primary tool, direct observation of the GitHub repository page ([https://github.com/ebaenamar/wikidata-mcp](https://github.com/ebaenamar/wikidata-mcp)) might be used for high-level contextual information not readily available or easily parsable via Context7, such as:
    *   Overall project structure (if Context7's view is limited).
    *   Issue tracker activity (number of open/closed issues, recent activity).
    *   Pull request history.
    *   Contributor information.
    *   Release history.
    *   Community files (e.g., `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`).
    *   *Note: The extent of use will be limited, prioritizing Context7 data.*

*   **Perplexity AI (via MCP Tool):** If specific conceptual questions arise that cannot be answered through Context7's direct repository access (e.g., general questions about technologies used if not detailed in the repo, or broader context of MCP), Perplexity AI might be used as a supplementary research tool. This usage will be secondary and focused on filling gaps not covered by direct repository analysis.

## 3. Information Management

*   All information gathered will be documented within the structured research directory (`research/wikidata_mcp_research/`).
*   Findings from Context7 will be recorded in the `02_data_collection` subfolder.
*   Citations or references to specific files or sections within the repository (as identified by Context7 or direct observation) will be maintained.
