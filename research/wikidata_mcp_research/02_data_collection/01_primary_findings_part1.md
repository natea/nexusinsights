# Primary Findings: `ebaenamar/wikidata-mcp` (Part 1)

## Initial Data Collection via Context7 MCP Server

The initial query to the Context7 MCP server using `get-library-docs` for the library ID `/ebaenamar/wikidata-mcp` returned a collection of documentation snippets. A significant portion of these snippets originates from README files within a subdirectory structure, specifically `wikidata-mcp-npm/node_modules/`. This suggests that the `ebaenamar/wikidata-mcp` repository contains a Node.js-based component or sub-project, likely named `wikidata-mcp-npm`, which utilizes various common JavaScript libraries for web development (e.g., Express, body-parser).

However, one crucial snippet was retrieved directly from the root `README.md` of the `ebaenamar/wikidata-mcp` repository, indicating a Python-based component or primary nature for the main project.

## Key Snippet from Root README.md

This snippet suggests that the primary project or a significant part of it is Python-based and involves setting up a virtual environment.

**TITLE:** Setting up Python Virtual Environment
**DESCRIPTION:** Commands to create and activate a Python virtual environment, isolating project dependencies from the system Python installation. Includes commands for both Unix-like systems and Windows.
**SOURCE:** [https://github.com/ebaenamar/wikidata-mcp/blob/master/README.md#_snippet_3](https://github.com/ebaenamar/wikidata-mcp/blob/master/README.md#_snippet_3)

**LANGUAGE:** bash
**CODE:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

**LANGUAGE:** bash
**CODE:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

**LANGUAGE:** cmd
**CODE:**
```cmd
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Subsequent parts of the primary findings will detail the snippets related to the Node.js dependencies found within the `wikidata-mcp-npm` subdirectory. The presence of both Python and Node.js components needs further investigation to understand their respective roles and interaction within the `wikidata-mcp` project.
