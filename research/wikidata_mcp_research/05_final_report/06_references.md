# References for Initial Research on `ebaenamar/wikidata-mcp`

This section lists the primary information sources and tools used during the initial research phase for the `ebaenamar/wikidata-mcp` project.

## Primary Project Repository

1.  **Repository:** `ebaenamar/wikidata-mcp`
    *   **URL:** `https://github.com/ebaenamar/wikidata-mcp`
    *   **Accessed:** May 12, 2025 (for data retrieval via Context7 MCP Server)
    *   **Note:** This was the primary target of the research.

## Tools Used

2.  **Context7 MCP Server:**
    *   **Tool:** `resolve-library-id`
        *   **Purpose:** To obtain the Context7-compatible library ID for the target repository.
    *   **Tool:** `get-library-docs`
        *   **Purpose:** To retrieve documentation snippets and code examples from the target repository.
        *   **Parameters Used:**
            *   `context7CompatibleLibraryID`: `/ebaenamar/wikidata-mcp`
            *   `topic`: (not specified for initial broad query)
            *   `tokens`: (default limit)
    *   **Note:** This was the sole data gathering tool for retrieving information directly *from* the repository in this initial phase.

## Key Documentation Snippets (from Dependencies via Context7)

The majority of detailed findings came from README files of Node.js dependencies located within the `wikidata-mcp-npm/node_modules/` subdirectory of the target repository. These are extensively documented with their sources in:

*   [`../02_data_collection/01_primary_findings_part1.md`](../02_data_collection/01_primary_findings_part1.md)
*   [`../02_data_collection/01_primary_findings_part2.md`](../02_data_collection/01_primary_findings_part2.md)
*   [`../02_data_collection/01_primary_findings_part3.md`](../02_data_collection/01_primary_findings_part3.md)

Each snippet in those files includes a "SOURCE" field pointing to its origin on GitHub (e.g., `https://github.com/ebaenamar/wikidata-mcp/blob/master/wikidata-mcp-npm/node_modules/express/Readme.md#_snippet_0`). Listing every individual dependency README here would be excessively long; please refer to the primary findings documents for specific source URLs of the retrieved snippets.

## Project-Specific Documentation Snippets (from Root via Context7)

*   **File:** `README.md` (root of `ebaenamar/wikidata-mcp`)
    *   **Snippet:** Python virtual environment setup.
    *   **Source:** `https://github.com/ebaenamar/wikidata-mcp/blob/master/README.md#_snippet_3` (as identified by Context7)
    *   **Reference:** Documented in [`../02_data_collection/01_primary_findings_part1.md`](../02_data_collection/01_primary_findings_part1.md).

## User-Provided Blueprint

*   **Document:** User task description providing the research goal and context.
    *   **Reference:** The initial prompt received for this research task.

*Note: As this initial phase focused on direct retrieval from the repository via Context7, external web pages, academic papers, or other secondary sources were not consulted and therefore are not listed here. Future research cycles, as recommended, would expand this list.*
