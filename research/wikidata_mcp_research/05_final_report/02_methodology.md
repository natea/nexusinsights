# Methodology for Initial Research on `ebaenamar/wikidata-mcp`

This document outlines the methodology employed during the initial research phase for the `ebaenamar/wikidata-mcp` GitHub repository. The research aimed to gain a foundational understanding of the project's purpose, architecture, and its relationship with Wikidata and the Model-Context Protocol (MCP).

## 1. Research Initialization and Scoping

*   **Objective Definition:** The primary goal was to conduct in-depth research on the `https://github.com/ebaenamar/wikidata-mcp` repository, as specified in the user blueprint.
*   **Output Structuring:** A dedicated output directory, `research/wikidata_mcp_research/`, was established within the project workspace to house all research artifacts. The structure of this directory was planned to follow a phased approach: initial queries, data collection, analysis, synthesis, and final reporting.
*   **Initial Key Questions:** Based on the project name and objectives, key research questions were formulated to guide the investigation. These are documented in `research/wikidata_mcp_research/01_initial_queries/02_key_questions.md`.
*   **Information Source Identification:** The primary information source for this initial phase was designated as the Context7 MCP server, with the GitHub repository itself as the target. This is documented in `research/wikidata_mcp_research/01_initial_queries/03_information_sources.md`.
*   **Scope Definition:** The scope was initially limited to what could be retrieved and analyzed via the Context7 MCP server's `get-library-docs` tool, focusing on readily available documentation within the repository. This is detailed in `research/wikidata_mcp_research/01_initial_queries/01_scope_definition.md`.

## 2. Data Collection via Context7 MCP Server

*   **Tool Invocation - `resolve-library-id`:**
    *   The Context7 MCP server was first invoked using the `resolve-library-id` tool with the `libraryName` parameter set to `ebaenamar/wikidata-mcp`.
    *   The tool successfully resolved this to the Context7-compatible library ID `/ebaenamar/wikidata-mcp`.
*   **Tool Invocation - `get-library-docs`:**
    *   The Context7 MCP server was then invoked using the `get-library-docs` tool.
    *   The `context7CompatibleLibraryID` parameter was set to `/ebaenamar/wikidata-mcp`.
    *   No specific `topic` was provided, and the default `tokens` limit was used to retrieve as much general documentation as possible.
*   **Data Collation:**
    *   The numerous code snippets and descriptions returned by `get-library-docs` were systematically documented in the `research/wikidata_mcp_research/02_data_collection/` directory, split into multiple parts due to volume:
        *   `01_primary_findings_part1.md`
        *   `01_primary_findings_part2.md`
        *   `01_primary_findings_part3.md`
    *   Files for `02_secondary_findings.md` and `03_expert_insights.md` were also created to note the absence of such information from this specific query.

## 3. First-Pass Analysis

*   **Pattern Identification:** The collected primary findings were reviewed to identify recurring themes, technological choices, and structural elements. These were documented in `research/wikidata_mcp_research/03_analysis/01_patterns_identified.md`.
*   **Contradiction/Unclarity Noting:** Areas where the information was insufficient, seemed to conflict with the project's implied purpose, or lacked clarity were noted in `research/wikidata_mcp_research/03_analysis/02_contradictions.md`.
*   **Knowledge Gap Definition:** Based on the initial questions, observed patterns, and unclarities, specific knowledge gaps requiring further investigation were defined in `research/wikidata_mcp_research/03_analysis/03_knowledge_gaps.md`.

## 4. Synthesis

*   **Integrated Model Development:** A preliminary, high-level model of the project's likely architecture and component interaction was developed based on the analysis. This is presented in `research/wikidata_mcp_research/04_synthesis/01_integrated_model.md`.
*   **Key Insight Distillation:** The most significant learnings and observations from the initial research phase were summarized in `research/wikidata_mcp_research/04_synthesis/02_key_insights.md`.
*   **Practical Application Speculation:** Potential practical uses of the project were hypothesized, assuming its purported goals are met. These are outlined in `research/wikidata_mcp_research/04_synthesis/03_practical_applications.md`.

## 5. Final Report Generation

*   The findings, analysis, and synthesis from the preceding stages were compiled into a structured final report within the `research/wikidata_mcp_research/05_final_report/` directory. This involved creating:
    *   A Table of Contents (`00_table_of_contents.md`)
    *   This Executive Summary (`01_executive_summary.md`)
    *   This Methodology document (`02_methodology.md`)
    *   Placeholders and initial content for Findings, Analysis, Recommendations, and References, which would be fully populated based on the earlier detailed documents.

## Limitations of this Methodology (Initial Phase)

*   **Dependency on Context7 `get-library-docs`:** This tool primarily retrieves content from README files and similar documentation. It may not capture information from dedicated documentation folders, wikis, or deeply embedded code comments.
*   **Limited Scope of Initial Query:** The initial query was broad. More targeted queries (e.g., using specific topics with Context7, or different tools like Perplexity AI for web searches) were deferred to subsequent research cycles.
*   **No Direct Code Analysis:** This initial phase did not involve manual browsing or in-depth analysis of the project's source code.
*   **Static View:** The information reflects the state of the repository at the time of the query and does not include dynamic aspects like commit history, issues, or pull requests.

This methodology provided a structured approach to an initial, tool-assisted exploration of the repository, successfully identifying key technological components and, crucially, defining the areas where deeper, more varied research techniques are now required.
