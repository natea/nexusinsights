# Recommendations for Further Research on `ebaenamar/wikidata-mcp`

Based on the initial research phase and the significant knowledge gaps identified (detailed in [`../03_analysis/03_knowledge_gaps.md`](../03_analysis/03_knowledge_gaps.md)), the following recommendations are made for subsequent research cycles to gain a comprehensive understanding of the `ebaenamar/wikidata-mcp` project:

1.  **Direct Repository Exploration and Code Review:**
    *   **Action:** Manually browse the `https://github.com/ebaenamar/wikidata-mcp` repository.
    *   **Focus Areas:**
        *   Identify the main Python scripts/modules. Analyze their structure, dependencies (e.g., `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile`), and infer their purpose from code and comments.
        *   Examine the custom JavaScript/TypeScript code within the `wikidata-mcp-npm` directory, beyond its `node_modules`. Look for route handlers, API definitions, and any logic related to Wikidata or MCP.
        *   Map out the overall directory structure. Look for dedicated documentation folders (e.g., `/docs`, `/doc`, `/wiki`) or files (e.g., `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, design documents).
    *   **Rationale:** This is crucial for understanding the project's own logic, which was not apparent from the dependency-focused initial scan.

2.  **Targeted Information Retrieval using Perplexity AI:**
    *   **Action:** Utilize the Perplexity AI MCP tool for targeted web searches.
    *   **Potential Queries:**
        *   "Model-Context Protocol implementation examples"
        *   "Model-Context Protocol Python libraries"
        *   "Model-Context Protocol Node.js libraries"
        *   "Tools for exposing Wikidata via API"
        *   "Python libraries for Wikidata interaction"
        *   Search for the repository name `ebaenamar/wikidata-mcp` or the author `ebaenamar` to find external mentions, articles, or related projects.
        *   If specific function names, class names, or unique string literals are found in the code review (Recommendation #1), use these as query terms.
    *   **Rationale:** To gather broader context about MCP, common practices for Wikidata integration, and to find any external discussions or documentation related to this specific project or its author. This will help fill gaps identified in [`../02_data_collection/02_secondary_findings.md`](../02_data_collection/02_secondary_findings.md) and [`../02_data_collection/03_expert_insights.md`](../02_data_collection/03_expert_insights.md).

3.  **Analyze Project Activity and Community (If Applicable):**
    *   **Action:** Examine the repository's "Insights" tab on GitHub (commit history, contributors), open/closed issues, and pull requests.
    *   **Focus Areas:**
        *   Frequency and nature of commits to gauge development activity.
        *   Discussions in issues or pull requests that might reveal design decisions, challenges, or use cases.
        *   Number of forks, stars, and watchers as indicators of community interest or adoption.
    *   **Rationale:** To understand the project's maturity, maintenance status, and any community interaction around it.

4.  **Attempt to Understand Component Interaction:**
    *   **Action:** Based on findings from code review, look for mechanisms of interaction between the Python and Node.js (`wikidata-mcp-npm`) components.
    *   **Focus Areas:**
        *   Inter-process communication (IPC) methods (e.g., sockets, message queues).
        *   Shared databases or file systems.
        *   API calls from one component to another (e.g., Node.js calling a local Python HTTP service, or vice-versa).
        *   Execution of Python scripts by the Node.js component, or vice-versa.
    *   **Rationale:** To build a more accurate integrated model ([`../04_synthesis/01_integrated_model.md`](../04_synthesis/01_integrated_model.md)) of how the system functions as a whole.

5.  **Re-evaluate with Context7 (If New Information Emerges):**
    *   **Action:** If direct code review reveals specific entry points, main files, or custom library structures within `ebaenamar/wikidata-mcp` that might be better suited for Context7's `get-library-docs` with a `topic` parameter, consider a more targeted re-query.
    *   **Rationale:** The initial broad query was useful for dependencies. A more informed query might yield better results for the project's own code if its structure becomes clearer.

6.  **Focus on "Wikidata" and "MCP" Keywords in Code:**
    *   **Action:** During code review, specifically search for keywords like "wikidata," "wd:", "SPARQL," "MCP," "ModelContextProtocol," "context," "model," "resource," "schema," etc.
    *   **Rationale:** To pinpoint the exact locations where the project implements its core named functionalities.

By pursuing these recommendations, a much clearer and more comprehensive understanding of the `ebaenamar/wikidata-mcp` project, its purpose, architecture, and specific implementation details regarding Wikidata and the Model-Context Protocol can be achieved. This will directly address the knowledge gaps identified in the initial research phase.
