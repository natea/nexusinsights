# Knowledge Gaps Identified for `ebaenamar/wikidata-mcp` (First Pass)

This document outlines the key knowledge gaps identified after the initial data collection (via Context7 MCP server) and first-pass analysis of the `ebaenamar/wikidata-mcp` repository. These gaps are derived from the initial research questions, observed patterns, and identified contradictions/unclarities. Addressing these gaps would be the focus of subsequent, targeted research cycles.

## Overarching Project Purpose and MCP Implementation

1.  **KG1: What is the specific purpose and functionality of the `ebaenamar/wikidata-mcp` project as a whole?**
    *   *Source:* Initial key question, Contradiction #1 (MCP in name vs. evident functionality).
    *   *Details:* The current data primarily details a Node.js web service infrastructure and hints at a Python component. The overarching goal, especially how it relates to "Wikidata" and the "Model-Context Protocol (MCP)," remains unclear. What problem does this project solve?

2.  **KG2: How does the project implement or utilize the Model-Context Protocol (MCP)?**
    *   *Source:* Initial key question, Contradiction #1.
    *   *Details:* No direct evidence of MCP implementation (schemas, specific protocol handlers, MCP-centric logic) was found in the retrieved snippets. Is MCP a core part of its architecture, a planned feature, or is the name symbolic? Where is the MCP-specific code or configuration?

3.  **KG3: What is the nature of the interaction with Wikidata?**
    *   *Source:* Initial key question, Contradiction #2.
    *   *Details:* The "Wikidata" aspect of the project is not illuminated by the current findings. How does the project query, process, or serve Wikidata? Which specific Wikidata services or datasets does it interact with?

## Architecture and Component Interaction

4.  **KG4: What is the precise role of the Python component, and how does it interact with the Node.js (`wikidata-mcp-npm`) component?**
    *   *Source:* Pattern #1 (Dual Technology Stack), Pattern #4 (Potential for Python CLI/Scripting), Contradiction #2.
    *   *Details:* Is the Python part the core engine (e.g., for Wikidata interaction, MCP logic) and the Node.js part an API layer? Are they loosely coupled tools or tightly integrated? What data or control flow exists between them?

5.  **KG5: What is the specific functionality of the `wikidata-mcp-npm` sub-project beyond being a generic web service?**
    *   *Source:* Pattern #2 (Focus on Web Service - Node.js), Pattern #6 (Indication of Sub-Project).
    *   *Details:* While it uses common web libraries, what specific APIs or services does `wikidata-mcp-npm` expose? How do these relate to the overall `wikidata-mcp` goals?

## Documentation and Project Structure

6.  **KG6: Where is the primary, high-level documentation for the `ebaenamar/wikidata-mcp` project itself (architecture, usage, contribution guidelines)?**
    *   *Source:* Pattern #5 (Documentation Primarily Through READMEs of Dependencies), Contradiction #3.
    *   *Details:* The Context7 query primarily returned documentation for dependencies. Is there a dedicated `/docs` folder, a project wiki, or extensive in-code documentation that was not captured?

7.  **KG7: What is the overall directory structure and purpose of key files/folders within the `ebaenamar/wikidata-mcp` repository, particularly for the Python component and any non-npm parts?**
    *   *Source:* General need for project understanding.
    *   *Details:* The `wikidata-mcp-npm` structure is somewhat clearer due to `node_modules`. The structure of the Python part and other potential top-level project files is unknown.

## Usage and Application

8.  **KG8: What are the intended use cases or example applications of `ebaenamar/wikidata-mcp`?**
    *   *Source:* Initial key question.
    *   *Details:* How would a developer or user set up and utilize this project? Are there example queries, input formats, or expected outputs?

9.  **KG9: What is the current development status and activity level of the project?**
    *   *Source:* General research interest.
    *   *Details:* Is the project actively maintained, experimental, or deprecated? (This would typically require looking at commit history, open issues, etc., beyond the scope of the initial Context7 query).

## Technical Details

10. **KG10: Are there specific data models or schemas defined and used by the project, especially concerning Wikidata entities or MCP messages?**
    *   *Source:* Implied by "Wikidata" and "MCP".
    *   *Details:* Understanding data structures is crucial for understanding data flow and processing.

Addressing these knowledge gaps will require moving beyond the initial Context7 `get-library-docs` query and employing other research methods, such as:
*   Directly browsing the GitHub repository.
*   Using Perplexity AI for broader web searches about MCP, Wikidata tools, and potentially the author or project name.
*   Analyzing code if accessible and understandable.
*   Looking for external mentions, forks, or discussions.
